    <h2>
      CHAPTER 1. THE PSAMMEAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were once four children who spent their summer holidays in a white
      house, happily situated between a sandpit and a chalkpit. One day they had
      the good fortune to find in the sandpit a strange creature. Its eyes were
      on long horns like snail&rsquo;s eyes, and it could move them in and out like
      telescopes. It had ears like a bat&rsquo;s ears, and its tubby body was shaped
      like a spider&rsquo;s and covered with thick soft fur&mdash;and it had hands and
      feet like a monkey&rsquo;s. It told the children&mdash;whose names were Cyril,
      Robert, Anthea, and Jane&mdash;that it was a Psammead or sand-fairy.
      (Psammead is pronounced Sammy-ad.) It was old, old, old, and its birthday
      was almost at the very beginning of everything. And it had been buried in
      the sand for thousands of years. But it still kept its fairylikeness, and
      part of this fairylikeness was its power to give people whatever they
      wished for. You know fairies have always been able to do this. Cyril,
      Robert, Anthea, and Jane now found their wishes come true; but, somehow,
      they never could think of just the right things to wish for, and their
      wishes sometimes turned out very oddly indeed. In the end their unwise
      wishings landed them in what Robert called &lsquo;a very tight place indeed&rsquo;,
      and the Psammead consented to help them out of it in return for their
      promise never never to ask it to grant them any more wishes, and never to
      tell anyone about it, because it did not want to be bothered to give
      wishes to anyone ever any more. At the moment of parting Jane said
      politely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we were going to see you again some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Psammead, touched by this friendly thought, granted the wish. The
      book about all this is called Five Children and It, and it ends up in a
      most tiresome way by saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The children DID see the Psammead again, but it was not in the sandpit;
      it was&mdash;but I must say no more&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason that nothing more could be said was that I had not then been
      able to find out exactly when and where the children met the Psammead
      again. Of course I knew they would meet it, because it was a beast of its
      word, and when it said a thing would happen, that thing happened without
      fail. How different from the people who tell us about what weather it is
      going to be on Thursday next, in London, the South Coast, and Channel!
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer holidays during which the Psammead had been found and the
      wishes given had been wonderful holidays in the country, and the children
      had the highest hopes of just such another holiday for the next summer.
      The winter holidays were beguiled by the wonderful happenings of The
      Phoenix and the Carpet, and the loss of these two treasures would have
      left the children in despair, but for the splendid hope of their next
      holiday in the country. The world, they felt, and indeed had some reason
      to feel, was full of wonderful things&mdash;and they were really the sort
      of people that wonderful things happen to. So they looked forward to the
      summer holiday; but when it came everything was different, and very, very
      horrid. Father had to go out to Manchuria to telegraph news about the war
      to the tiresome paper he wrote for&mdash;the Daily Bellower, or something
      like that, was its name. And Mother, poor dear Mother, was away in
      Madeira, because she had been very ill. And The Lamb&mdash;I mean the baby&mdash;was
      with her. And Aunt Emma, who was Mother&rsquo;s sister, had suddenly married
      Uncle Reginald, who was Father&rsquo;s brother, and they had gone to China,
      which is much too far off for you to expect to be asked to spend the
      holidays in, however fond your aunt and uncle may be of you. So the
      children were left in the care of old Nurse, who lived in Fitzroy Street,
      near the British Museum, and though she was always very kind to them, and
      indeed spoiled them far more than would be good for the most grown-up of
      us, the four children felt perfectly wretched, and when the cab had driven
      off with Father and all his boxes and guns and the sheepskin, with
      blankets and the aluminium mess-kit inside it, the stoutest heart quailed,
      and the girls broke down altogether, and sobbed in each other&rsquo;s arms,
      while the boys each looked out of one of the long gloomy windows of the
      parlour, and tried to pretend that no boy would be such a muff as to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you notice that they were not cowardly enough to cry till their
      Father had gone; they knew he had quite enough to upset him without that.
      But when he was gone everyone felt as if it had been trying not to cry all
      its life, and that it must cry now, if it died for it. So they cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea&mdash;with shrimps and watercress&mdash;cheered them a little. The
      watercress was arranged in a hedge round a fat glass salt-cellar, a
      tasteful device they had never seen before. But it was not a cheerful
      meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea Anthea went up to the room that had been Father&rsquo;s, and when she
      saw how dreadfully he wasn&rsquo;t there, and remembered how every minute was
      taking him further and further from her, and nearer and nearer to the guns
      of the Russians, she cried a little more. Then she thought of Mother, ill
      and alone, and perhaps at that very moment wanting a little girl to put
      eau-de-cologne on her head, and make her sudden cups of tea, and she cried
      more than ever. And then she remembered what Mother had said, the night
      before she went away, about Anthea being the eldest girl, and about trying
      to make the others happy, and things like that. So she stopped crying, and
      thought instead. And when she had thought as long as she could bear she
      washed her face and combed her hair, and went down to the others, trying
      her best to look as though crying were an exercise she had never even
      heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found the parlour in deepest gloom, hardly relieved at all by the
      efforts of Robert, who, to make the time pass, was pulling Jane&rsquo;s hair&mdash;not
      hard, but just enough to tease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a palaver.&rsquo; This word dated from the
      awful day when Cyril had carelessly wished that there were Red Indians in
      England&mdash;and there had been. The word brought back memories of last
      summer holidays and everyone groaned; they thought of the white house with
      the beautiful tangled garden&mdash;late roses, asters, marigold, sweet
      mignonette, and feathery asparagus&mdash;of the wilderness which someone
      had once meant to make into an orchard, but which was now, as Father said,
      &lsquo;five acres of thistles haunted by the ghosts of baby cherry-trees&rsquo;. They
      thought of the view across the valley, where the lime-kilns looked like
      Aladdin&rsquo;s palaces in the sunshine, and they thought of their own sandpit,
      with its fringe of yellowy grasses and pale-stringy-stalked wild flowers,
      and the little holes in the cliff that were the little sand-martins&rsquo; 
      little front doors. And they thought of the free fresh air smelling of
      thyme and sweetbriar, and the scent of the wood-smoke from the cottages in
      the lane&mdash;and they looked round old Nurse&rsquo;s stuffy parlour, and Jane
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how different it all is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was. Old Nurse had been in the habit of letting lodgings, till Father
      gave her the children to take care of. And her rooms were furnished &lsquo;for
      letting&rsquo;. Now it is a very odd thing that no one ever seems to furnish a
      room &lsquo;for letting&rsquo; in a bit the same way as one would furnish it for
      living in. This room had heavy dark red stuff curtains&mdash;the colour
      that blood would not make a stain on&mdash;with coarse lace curtains
      inside. The carpet was yellow, and violet, with bits of grey and brown
      oilcloth in odd places. The fireplace had shavings and tinsel in it. There
      was a very varnished mahogany chiffonier, or sideboard, with a lock that
      wouldn&rsquo;t act. There were hard chairs&mdash;far too many of them&mdash;with
      crochet antimacassars slipping off their seats, all of which sloped the
      wrong way. The table wore a cloth of a cruel green colour with a yellow
      chain-stitch pattern round it. Over the fireplace was a looking-glass that
      made you look much uglier than you really were, however plain you might be
      to begin with. Then there was a mantelboard with maroon plush and wool
      fringe that did not match the plush; a dreary clock like a black marble
      tomb&mdash;it was silent as the grave too, for it had long since forgotten
      how to tick. And there were painted glass vases that never had any flowers
      in, and a painted tambourine that no one ever played, and painted brackets
      with nothing on them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;And maple-framed engravings of the Queen, the Houses of
  Parliament, the Plains of Heaven, and of a blunt-nosed
  woodman&rsquo;s flat return.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      There were two books&mdash;last December&rsquo;s Bradshaw, and an odd volume of
      Plumridge&rsquo;s Commentary on Thessalonians. There were&mdash;but I cannot
      dwell longer on this painful picture. It was indeed, as Jane said, very
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a palaver,&rsquo; said Anthea again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about?&rsquo; said Cyril, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to have ANYTHING about,&rsquo; said Robert kicking the leg of
      the table miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to play,&rsquo; said Jane, and her tone was grumpy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea tried very hard not to be cross. She succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t think I want to be preachy or a beast in any
      way, but I want to what Father calls define the situation. Do you agree?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fire ahead,&rsquo; said Cyril without enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then. We all know the reason we&rsquo;re staying here is because Nurse
      couldn&rsquo;t leave her house on account of the poor learned gentleman on the
      top-floor. And there was no one else Father could entrust to take care of
      us&mdash;and you know it&rsquo;s taken a lot of money, Mother&rsquo;s going to Madeira
      to be made well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane sniffed miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know,&rsquo; said Anthea in a hurry, &lsquo;but don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s think about how
      horrid it all is. I mean we can&rsquo;t go to things that cost a lot, but we
      must do SOMETHING. And I know there are heaps of things you can see in
      London without paying for them, and I thought we&rsquo;d go and see them. We are
      all quite old now, and we haven&rsquo;t got The Lamb&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane sniffed harder than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean no one can say &ldquo;No&rdquo; because of him, dear pet. And I thought we
      MUST get Nurse to see how quite old we are, and let us go out by
      ourselves, or else we shall never have any sort of a time at all. And I
      vote we see everything there is, and let&rsquo;s begin by asking Nurse to give
      us some bits of bread and we&rsquo;ll go to St James&rsquo;s Park. There are ducks
      there, I know, we can feed them. Only we must make Nurse let us go by
      ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hurrah for liberty!&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;but she won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes she will,&rsquo; said Jane unexpectedly. &lsquo;<i>I</i> thought about that this
      morning, and I asked Father, and he said yes; and what&rsquo;s more he told old
      Nurse we might, only he said we must always say where we wanted to go, and
      if it was right she would let us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three cheers for thoughtful Jane,&rsquo; cried Cyril, now roused at last from
      his yawning despair. &lsquo;I say, let&rsquo;s go now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went, old Nurse only begging them to be careful of crossings, and
      to ask a policeman to assist in the more difficult cases. But they were
      used to crossings, for they had lived in Camden Town and knew the Kentish
      Town Road where the trams rush up and down like mad at all hours of the
      day and night, and seem as though, if anything, they would rather run over
      you than not.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had promised to be home by dark, but it was July, so dark would be
      very late indeed, and long past bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      They started to walk to St James&rsquo;s Park, and all their pockets were
      stuffed with bits of bread and the crusts of toast, to feed the ducks
      with. They started, I repeat, but they never got there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Fitzroy Street and St James&rsquo;s Park there are a great many streets,
      and, if you go the right way you will pass a great many shops that you
      cannot possibly help stopping to look at. The children stopped to look at
      several with gold-lace and beads and pictures and jewellery and dresses,
      and hats, and oysters and lobsters in their windows, and their sorrow did
      not seem nearly so impossible to bear as it had done in the best parlour
      at No. 300, Fitzroy Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, by some wonderful chance turn of Robert&rsquo;s (who had been voted
      Captain because the girls thought it would be good for him&mdash;and
      indeed he thought so himself&mdash;and of course Cyril couldn&rsquo;t vote
      against him because it would have looked like a mean jealousy), they came
      into the little interesting criss-crossy streets that held the most
      interesting shops of all&mdash;the shops where live things were sold.
      There was one shop window entirely filled with cages, and all sorts of
      beautiful birds in them. The children were delighted till they remembered
      how they had once wished for wings themselves, and had had them&mdash;and
      then they felt how desperately unhappy anything with wings must be if it
      is shut up in a cage and not allowed to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be fairly beastly to be a bird in a cage,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;Come on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on, and Cyril tried to think out a scheme for making his fortune
      as a gold-digger at Klondyke, and then buying all the caged birds in the
      world and setting them free. Then they came to a shop that sold cats, but
      the cats were in cages, and the children could not help wishing someone
      would buy all the cats and put them on hearthrugs, which are the proper
      places for cats. And there was the dog-shop, and that was not a happy
      thing to look at either, because all the dogs were chained or caged, and
      all the dogs, big and little, looked at the four children with sad wistful
      eyes and wagged beseeching tails as if they were trying to say, &lsquo;Buy me!
      buy me! buy me! and let me go for a walk with you; oh, do buy me, and buy
      my poor brothers too! Do! do! do!&rsquo; They almost said, &lsquo;Do! do! do!&rsquo; plain
      to the ear, as they whined; all but one big Irish terrier, and he growled
      when Jane patted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grrrrr,&rsquo; he seemed to say, as he looked at them from the back corner of
      his eye&mdash;&lsquo;YOU won&rsquo;t buy me. Nobody will&mdash;ever&mdash;I shall die
      chained up&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know that I care how soon it is, either!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know that the children would have understood all this, only once
      they had been in a besieged castle, so they knew how hateful it is to be
      kept in when you want to get out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they could not buy any of the dogs. They did, indeed, ask the
      price of the very, very smallest, and it was sixty-five pounds&mdash;but
      that was because it was a Japanese toy spaniel like the Queen once had her
      portrait painted with, when she was only Princess of Wales. But the
      children thought, if the smallest was all that money, the biggest would
      run into thousands&mdash;so they went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they did not stop at any more cat or dog or bird shops, but passed
      them by, and at last they came to a shop that seemed as though it only
      sold creatures that did not much mind where they were&mdash;such as
      goldfish and white mice, and sea-anemones and other aquarium beasts, and
      lizards and toads, and hedgehogs and tortoises, and tame rabbits and
      guinea-pigs. And there they stopped for a long time, and fed the
      guinea-pigs with bits of bread through the cage-bars, and wondered whether
      it would be possible to keep a sandy-coloured double-lop in the basement
      of the house in Fitzroy Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose old Nurse would mind VERY much,&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;Rabbits are
      most awfully tame sometimes. I expect it would know her voice and follow
      her all about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;d tumble over it twenty times a day,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;now a snake&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There aren&rsquo;t any snakes, said Robert hastily, &lsquo;and besides, I never could
      cotton to snakes somehow&mdash;I wonder why.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worms are as bad,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;and eels and slugs&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s
      because we don&rsquo;t like things that haven&rsquo;t got legs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father says snakes have got legs hidden away inside of them,&rsquo; said
      Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;and he says WE&rsquo;VE got tails hidden away inside us&mdash;but it
      doesn&rsquo;t either of it come to anything REALLY,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;I hate things
      that haven&rsquo;t any legs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s worse when they have too many,&rsquo; said Jane with a shudder, &lsquo;think of
      centipedes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood there on the pavement, a cause of some inconvenience to the
      passersby, and thus beguiled the time with conversation. Cyril was leaning
      his elbow on the top of a hutch that had seemed empty when they had
      inspected the whole edifice of hutches one by one, and he was trying to
      reawaken the interest of a hedgehog that had curled itself into a ball
      earlier in the interview, when a small, soft voice just below his elbow
      said, quietly, plainly and quite unmistakably&mdash;not in any squeak or
      whine that had to be translated&mdash;but in downright common English&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Buy me&mdash;do&mdash;please buy me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril started as though he had been pinched, and jumped a yard away from
      the hutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come back&mdash;oh, come back!&rsquo; said the voice, rather louder but still
      softly; &lsquo;stoop down and pretend to be tying up your bootlace&mdash;I see
      it&rsquo;s undone, as usual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril mechanically obeyed. He knelt on one knee on the dry, hot dusty
      pavement, peered into the darkness of the hutch and found himself face to
      face with&mdash;the Psammead!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed much thinner than when he had last seen it. It was dusty and
      dirty, and its fur was untidy and ragged. It had hunched itself up into a
      miserable lump, and its long snail&rsquo;s eyes were drawn in quite tight so
      that they hardly showed at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; said the Psammead, in a voice that sounded as though it would
      begin to cry in a minute, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think the creature who keeps this shop
      will ask a very high price for me. I&rsquo;ve bitten him more than once, and
      I&rsquo;ve made myself look as common as I can. He&rsquo;s never had a glance from my
      beautiful, beautiful eyes. Tell the others I&rsquo;m here&mdash;but tell them to
      look at some of those low, common beasts while I&rsquo;m talking to you. The
      creature inside mustn&rsquo;t think you care much about me, or he&rsquo;ll put a price
      upon me far, far beyond your means. I remember in the dear old days last
      summer you never had much money. Oh&mdash;I never thought I should be so
      glad to see you&mdash;I never did.&rsquo; It sniffed, and shot out its long
      snail&rsquo;s eyes expressly to drop a tear well away from its fur. &lsquo;Tell the
      others I&rsquo;m here, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly what to do about buying
      me.&rsquo; Cyril tied his bootlace into a hard knot, stood up and addressed the
      others in firm tones&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not kidding&mdash;and I appeal to your honour,&rsquo; 
      an appeal which in this family was never made in vain. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look at that
      hutch&mdash;look at the white rat. Now you are not to look at that hutch
      whatever I say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in front of it to prevent mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now get yourselves ready for a great surprise. In that hutch there&rsquo;s an
      old friend of ours&mdash;DON&rsquo;T look!&mdash;Yes; it&rsquo;s the Psammead, the
      good old Psammead! it wants us to buy it. It says you&rsquo;re not to look at
      it. Look at the white rat and count your money! On your honour don&rsquo;t
      look!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The others responded nobly. They looked at the white rat till they quite
      stared him out of countenance, so that he went and sat up on his hind legs
      in a far corner and hid his eyes with his front paws, and pretended he was
      washing his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril stooped again, busying himself with the other bootlace and listened
      for the Psammead&rsquo;s further instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go in,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;and ask the price of lots of other things.
      Then say, &ldquo;What do you want for that monkey that&rsquo;s lost its tail&mdash;the
      mangy old thing in the third hutch from the end.&rdquo; Oh&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind MY
      feelings&mdash;call me a mangy monkey&mdash;I&rsquo;ve tried hard enough to look
      like one! I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll put a high price on me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve bitten him
      eleven times since I came here the day before yesterday. If he names a
      bigger price than you can afford, say you wish you had the money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t give us wishes. I&rsquo;ve promised never to have another wish
      from you,&rsquo; said the bewildered Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a silly little idiot,&rsquo; said the Sand-fairy in trembling but
      affectionate tones, &lsquo;but find out how much money you&rsquo;ve got between you,
      and do exactly what I tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril, pointing a stiff and unmeaning finger at the white rat, so as to
      pretend that its charms alone employed his tongue, explained matters to
      the others, while the Psammead hunched itself, and bunched itself, and did
      its very best to make itself look uninteresting. Then the four children
      filed into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much do you want for that white rat?&rsquo; asked Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eightpence,&rsquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the guinea-pigs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eighteenpence to five bob, according to the breed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the lizards?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ninepence each.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And toads?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fourpence. Now look here,&rsquo; said the greasy owner of all this caged life
      with a sudden ferocity which made the whole party back hurriedly on to the
      wainscoting of hutches with which the shop was lined. &lsquo;Lookee here. I
      ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to have you a comin&rsquo; in here a turnin&rsquo; the whole place outer
      winder, an&rsquo; prizing every animile in the stock just for your larks, so
      don&rsquo;t think it! If you&rsquo;re a buyer, BE a buyer&mdash;but I never had a
      customer yet as wanted to buy mice, and lizards, and toads, and guineas
      all at once. So hout you goes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! wait a minute,&rsquo; said the wretched Cyril, feeling how foolishly yet
      well-meaningly he had carried out the Psammead&rsquo;s instructions. &lsquo;Just tell
      me one thing. What do you want for the mangy old monkey in the third hutch
      from the end?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The shopman only saw in this a new insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mangy young monkey yourself,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;get along with your blooming
      cheek. Hout you goes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t be so cross,&rsquo; said Jane, losing her head altogether, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you
      see he really DOES want to know THAT!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ho! does &lsquo;e indeed,&rsquo; sneered the merchant. Then he scratched his ear
      suspiciously, for he was a sharp business man, and he knew the ring of
      truth when he heard it. His hand was bandaged, and three minutes before he
      would have been glad to sell the &lsquo;mangy old monkey&rsquo; for ten shillings. Now&mdash;&lsquo;Ho!
      &lsquo;e does, does &lsquo;e,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;then two pun ten&rsquo;s my price. He&rsquo;s not got his
      fellow that monkey ain&rsquo;t, nor yet his match, not this side of the equator,
      which he comes from. And the only one ever seen in London. Ought to be in
      the Zoo. Two pun ten, down on the nail, or hout you goes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children looked at each other&mdash;twenty-three shillings and
      fivepence was all they had in the world, and it would have been merely
      three and fivepence, but for the sovereign which Father had given to them
      &lsquo;between them&rsquo; at parting. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve only twenty-three shillings and
      fivepence,&rsquo; said Cyril, rattling the money in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty-three farthings and somebody&rsquo;s own cheek,&rsquo; said the dealer, for he
      did not believe that Cyril had so much money.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a miserable pause. Then Anthea remembered, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I WISH I had two pounds ten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I, Miss, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said the man with bitter politeness; &lsquo;I wish
      you &lsquo;ad, I&rsquo;m sure!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea&rsquo;s hand was on the counter, something seemed to slide under it. She
      lifted it. There lay five bright half sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I HAVE got it after all,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;here&rsquo;s the money, now let&rsquo;s
      have the Sammy,... the monkey I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dealer looked hard at the money, but he made haste to put it in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only hope you come by it honest,&rsquo; he said, shrugging his shoulders. He
      scratched his ear again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I suppose I must let you have it, but it&rsquo;s worth
      thribble the money, so it is&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly led the way out to the hutch&mdash;opened the door gingerly, and
      made a sudden fierce grab at the Psammead, which the Psammead acknowledged
      in one last long lingering bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, take the brute,&rsquo; said the shopman, squeezing the Psammead so tight
      that he nearly choked it. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s bit me to the marrow, it have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s eyes opened as Anthea held out her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me if it tears your face off its bones,&rsquo; he said, and the
      Psammead made a leap from his dirty horny hands, and Anthea caught it in
      hers, which were not very clean, certainly, but at any rate were soft and
      pink, and held it kindly and closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t take it home like that,&rsquo; Cyril said, &lsquo;we shall have a crowd
      after us,&rsquo; and indeed two errand boys and a policeman had already
      collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give you nothink only a paper-bag, like what we put the tortoises
      in,&rsquo; said the man grudgingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the whole party went into the shop, and the shopman&rsquo;s eyes nearly came
      out of his head when, having given Anthea the largest paper-bag he could
      find, he saw her hold it open, and the Psammead carefully creep into it.
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if that there don&rsquo;t beat cockfighting! But p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ve
      met the brute afore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Cyril affably, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s an old friend of ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I&rsquo;d a known that,&rsquo; the man rejoined, &lsquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t a had him under
      twice the money. &lsquo;Owever,&rsquo; he added, as the children disappeared, &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t
      done so bad, seeing as I only give five bob for the beast. But then
      there&rsquo;s the bites to take into account!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children trembling in agitation and excitement, carried home the
      Psammead, trembling in its paper-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got it home, Anthea nursed it, and stroked it, and would have
      cried over it, if she hadn&rsquo;t remembered how it hated to be wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it recovered enough to speak, it said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get me sand; silver sand from the oil and colour shop. And get me
      plenty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They got the sand, and they put it and the Psammead in the round bath
      together, and it rubbed itself, and rolled itself, and shook itself and
      scraped itself, and scratched itself, and preened itself, till it felt
      clean and comfy, and then it scrabbled a hasty hole in the sand, and went
      to sleep in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children hid the bath under the girls&rsquo; bed, and had supper. Old Nurse
      had got them a lovely supper of bread and butter and fried onions. She was
      full of kind and delicate thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anthea woke the next morning, the Psammead was snuggling down between
      her shoulder and Jane&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have saved my life,&rsquo; it said. &lsquo;I know that man would have thrown cold
      water on me sooner or later, and then I should have died. I saw him wash
      out a guinea-pig&rsquo;s hutch yesterday morning. I&rsquo;m still frightfully sleepy,
      I think I&rsquo;ll go back to sand for another nap. Wake the boys and this
      dormouse of a Jane, and when you&rsquo;ve had your breakfasts we&rsquo;ll have a
      talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t YOU want any breakfast?&rsquo; asked Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay I shall pick a bit presently,&rsquo; it said; &lsquo;but sand is all I care
      about&mdash;it&rsquo;s meat and drink to me, and coals and fire and wife and
      children.&rsquo; With these words it clambered down by the bedclothes and
      scrambled back into the bath, where they heard it scratching itself out of
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;anyhow our holidays won&rsquo;t be dull NOW. We&rsquo;ve found
      the Psammead again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Jane, beginning to put on her stockings. &lsquo;We shan&rsquo;t be dull&mdash;but
      it&rsquo;ll be only like having a pet dog now it can&rsquo;t give us wishes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so discontented,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;If it can&rsquo;t do anything else
      it can tell us about Megatheriums and things.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2. THE HALF AMULET
    </h2>
    <p>
      Long ago&mdash;that is to say last summer&mdash;the children, finding
      themselves embarrassed by some wish which the Psammead had granted them,
      and which the servants had not received in a proper spirit, had wished
      that the servants might not notice the gifts which the Psammead gave. And
      when they parted from the Psammead their last wish had been that they
      should meet it again. Therefore they HAD met it (and it was jolly lucky
      for the Psammead, as Robert pointed out). Now, of course, you see that the
      Psammead&rsquo;s being where it was, was the consequence of one of their wishes,
      and therefore was a Psammead-wish, and as such could not be noticed by the
      servants. And it was soon plain that in the Psammead&rsquo;s opinion old Nurse
      was still a servant, although she had now a house of her own, for she
      never noticed the Psammead at all. And that was as well, for she would
      never have consented to allow the girls to keep an animal and a bath of
      sand under their bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast had been cleared away&mdash;it was a very nice breakfast
      with hot rolls to it, a luxury quite out of the common way&mdash;Anthea
      went and dragged out the bath, and woke the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stretched and shook itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have bolted your breakfast most unwholesomely,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;you
      can&rsquo;t have been five minutes over it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been nearly an hour,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Come&mdash;you know you
      promised.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now look here,&rsquo; said the Psammead, sitting back on the sand and shooting
      out its long eyes suddenly, &lsquo;we&rsquo;d better begin as we mean to go on. It
      won&rsquo;t do to have any misunderstanding, so I tell you plainly that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, PLEASE,&rsquo; Anthea pleaded, &lsquo;do wait till we get to the others. They&rsquo;ll
      think it most awfully sneakish of me to talk to you without them; do come
      down, there&rsquo;s a dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt before the sand-bath and held out her arms. The Psammead must
      have remembered how glad it had been to jump into those same little arms
      only the day before, for it gave a little grudging grunt, and jumped once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea wrapped it in her pinafore and carried it downstairs. It was
      welcomed in a thrilling silence. At last Anthea said, &lsquo;Now then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What place is this?&rsquo; asked the Psammead, shooting its eyes out and
      turning them slowly round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a sitting-room, of course,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I don&rsquo;t like it,&rsquo; said the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Anthea kindly; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll take you anywhere you like if you
      want us to. What was it you were going to say upstairs when I said the
      others wouldn&rsquo;t like it if I stayed talking to you without them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked keenly at her, and she blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rsquo; it said sharply. &lsquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s quite natural that you
      should like your brothers and sisters to know exactly how good and
      unselfish you were.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;Anthea was quite right. What was it you
      were going to say when she stopped you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;since you&rsquo;re so anxious to know. I
      was going to say this. You&rsquo;ve saved my life&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not ungrateful&mdash;but
      it doesn&rsquo;t change your nature or mine. You&rsquo;re still very ignorant, and
      rather silly, and I am worth a thousand of you any day of the week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you are!&rsquo; Anthea was beginning but it interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very rude to interrupt,&rsquo; it said; &lsquo;what I mean is that I&rsquo;m not going
      to stand any nonsense, and if you think what you&rsquo;ve done is to give you
      the right to pet me or make me demean myself by playing with you, you&rsquo;ll
      find out that what you think doesn&rsquo;t matter a single penny. See? It&rsquo;s what
      <i>I</i> think that matters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;it always was, if you remember.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;then that&rsquo;s settled. We&rsquo;re to be treated as we
      deserve. I with respect, and all of you with&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t wish to be
      offensive. Do you want me to tell you how I got into that horrible den you
      bought me out of? Oh, I&rsquo;m not ungrateful! I haven&rsquo;t forgotten it and I
      shan&rsquo;t forget it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do tell us,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;I know you&rsquo;re awfully clever, but even with
      all your cleverness, I don&rsquo;t believe you can possibly know how&mdash;how
      respectfully we do respect you. Don&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The others all said yes&mdash;and fidgeted in their chairs. Robert spoke
      the wishes of all when he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d go on.&rsquo; So it sat up on the green-covered table and went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you&rsquo;d gone away,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;I went to sand for a bit, and slept. I
      was tired out with all your silly wishes, and I felt as though I hadn&rsquo;t
      really been to sand for a year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To sand?&rsquo; Jane repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where I sleep. You go to bed. I go to sand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane yawned; the mention of bed made her feel sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said the Psammead, in offended tones. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure <i>I</i>
      don&rsquo;t want to tell you a long tale. A man caught me, and I bit him. And he
      put me in a bag with a dead hare and a dead rabbit. And he took me to his
      house and put me out of the bag into a basket with holes that I could see
      through. And I bit him again. And then he brought me to this city, which I
      am told is called the Modern Babylon&mdash;though it&rsquo;s not a bit like the
      old Babylon&mdash;and he sold me to the man you bought me from, and then I
      bit them both. Now, what&rsquo;s your news?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not quite so much biting in our story,&rsquo; said Cyril regretfully;
      &lsquo;in fact, there isn&rsquo;t any. Father&rsquo;s gone to Manchuria, and Mother and The
      Lamb have gone to Madeira because Mother was ill, and don&rsquo;t I just wish
      that they were both safe home again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Merely from habit, the Sand-fairy began to blow itself out, but it stopped
      short suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgot,&rsquo; it said; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give you any more wishes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;but look here,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t we call in old Nurse and
      get her to say SHE wishes they were safe home. I&rsquo;m sure she does.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No go,&rsquo; said the Psammead. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just the same as your wishing yourself
      if you get some one else to wish for you. It won&rsquo;t act.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it did yesterday&mdash;with the man in the shop,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah yes,&rsquo; said the creature, &lsquo;but you didn&rsquo;t ASK him to wish, and you
      didn&rsquo;t know what would happen if he did. That can&rsquo;t be done again. It&rsquo;s
      played out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you can&rsquo;t help us at all,&rsquo; said Jane; &lsquo;oh&mdash;I did think you
      could do something; I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it ever since we saved your
      life yesterday. I thought you&rsquo;d be certain to be able to fetch back
      Father, even if you couldn&rsquo;t manage Mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jane began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now DON&rsquo;T,&rsquo; said the Psammead hastily; &lsquo;you know how it always upsets me
      if you cry. I can&rsquo;t feel safe a moment. Look here; you must have some new
      kind of charm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s easier said than done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; said the creature; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s one of the strongest charms
      in the world not a stone&rsquo;s throw from where you bought me yesterday. The
      man that I bit so&mdash;the first one, I mean&mdash;went into a shop to
      ask how much something cost&mdash;I think he said it was a concertina&mdash;and
      while he was telling the man in the shop how much too much he wanted for
      it, I saw the charm in a sort of tray, with a lot of other things. If you
      can only buy THAT, you will be able to have your heart&rsquo;s desire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children looked at each other and then at the Psammead. Then Cyril
      coughed awkwardly and took sudden courage to say what everyone was
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do hope you won&rsquo;t be waxy,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s like this: when you used
      to give us our wishes they almost always got us into some row or other,
      and we used to think you wouldn&rsquo;t have been pleased if they hadn&rsquo;t. Now,
      about this charm&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t got over and above too much tin, and if
      we blue it all on this charm and it turns out to be not up to much&mdash;well&mdash;you
      see what I&rsquo;m driving at, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see that YOU don&rsquo;t see more than the length of your nose, and THAT&rsquo;S
      not far,&rsquo; said the Psammead crossly. &lsquo;Look here, I HAD to give you the
      wishes, and of course they turned out badly, in a sort of way, because you
      hadn&rsquo;t the sense to wish for what was good for you. But this charm&rsquo;s quite
      different. I haven&rsquo;t GOT to do this for you, it&rsquo;s just my own generous
      kindness that makes me tell you about it. So it&rsquo;s bound to be all right.
      See?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;Please, PLEASE don&rsquo;t. You see, it&rsquo;s all
      we&rsquo;ve got; we shan&rsquo;t have any more pocket-money till Daddy comes home&mdash;unless
      he sends us some in a letter. But we DO trust you. And I say all of you,&rsquo; 
      she went on, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s worth spending ALL the money, if
      there&rsquo;s even the chanciest chance of getting Father and Mother back safe
      NOW? Just think of it! Oh, do let&rsquo;s!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t care what you do,&rsquo; said the Psammead; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to
      sand again till you&rsquo;ve made up your minds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said everybody; and Jane added, &lsquo;We are quite mind made-up&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you see we are? Let&rsquo;s get our hats. Will you come with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said the Psammead; &lsquo;how else would you find the shop?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So everybody got its hat. The Psammead was put into a flat bass-bag that
      had come from Farringdon Market with two pounds of filleted plaice in it.
      Now it contained about three pounds and a quarter of solid Psammead, and
      the children took it in turns to carry it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not half the weight of The Lamb,&rsquo; Robert said, and the girls sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead poked a wary eye out of the top of the basket every now and
      then, and told the children which turnings to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How on earth do you know?&rsquo; asked Robert. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think how you do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Psammead said sharply, &lsquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they came to THE shop. It had all sorts and kinds of things in the
      window&mdash;concertinas, and silk handkerchiefs, china vases and
      tea-cups, blue Japanese jars, pipes, swords, pistols, lace collars, silver
      spoons tied up in half-dozens, and wedding-rings in a red lacquered basin.
      There were officers&rsquo; epaulets and doctors&rsquo; lancets. There were tea-caddies
      inlaid with red turtle-shell and brass curly-wurlies, plates of different
      kinds of money, and stacks of different kinds of plates. There was a
      beautiful picture of a little girl washing a dog, which Jane liked very
      much. And in the middle of the window there was a dirty silver tray full
      of mother-of-pearl card counters, old seals, paste buckles, snuff-boxes,
      and all sorts of little dingy odds and ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead put its head quite out of the fish-basket to look in the
      window, when Cyril said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a tray there with rubbish in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then its long snail&rsquo;s eyes saw something that made them stretch out so
      much that they were as long and thin as new slate-pencils. Its fur
      bristled thickly, and its voice was quite hoarse with excitement as it
      whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s it! There, under that blue and yellow buckle, you can
      see a bit sticking out. It&rsquo;s red. Do you see?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it that thing something like a horse-shoe?&rsquo; asked Cyril. &lsquo;And red,
      like the common sealing-wax you do up parcels with?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; 
      said the Psammead. &lsquo;Now, you do just as you did before. Ask the price of
      other things. That blue buckle would do. Then the man will get the tray
      out of the window. I think you&rsquo;d better be the one,&rsquo; it said to Anthea.
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll wait out here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the others flattened their noses against the shop window, and presently
      a large, dirty, short-fingered hand with a very big diamond ring came
      stretching through the green half-curtains at the back of the shop window
      and took away the tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not see what was happening in the interview between Anthea and
      the Diamond Ring, and it seemed to them that she had had time&mdash;if she
      had had money&mdash;to buy everything in the shop before the moment came
      when she stood before them, her face wreathed in grins, as Cyril said
      later, and in her hand the charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was something like this: [Drawing omitted.] and it was made of a red,
      smooth, softly shiny stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rsquo; Anthea whispered, just opening her hand to give the others
      a glimpse of it. &lsquo;Do let&rsquo;s get home. We can&rsquo;t stand here like stuck-pigs
      looking at it in the street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So home they went. The parlour in Fitzroy Street was a very flat
      background to magic happenings. Down in the country among the flowers and
      green fields anything had seemed&mdash;and indeed had been&mdash;possible.
      But it was hard to believe that anything really wonderful could happen so
      near the Tottenham Court Road. But the Psammead was there&mdash;and it in
      itself was wonderful. And it could talk&mdash;and it had shown them where
      a charm could be bought that would make the owner of it perfectly happy.
      So the four children hurried home, taking very long steps, with their
      chins stuck out, and their mouths shut very tight indeed. They went so
      fast that the Psammead was quite shaken about in its fish-bag, but it did
      not say anything&mdash;perhaps for fear of attracting public notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got home at last, very hot indeed, and set the Psammead on the green
      tablecloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now then!&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Psammead had to have a plate of sand fetched for it, for it was
      quite faint. When it had refreshed itself a little it said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now then! Let me see the charm,&rsquo; and Anthea laid it on the green
      table-cover. The Psammead shot out his long eyes to look at it, then it
      turned them reproachfully on Anthea and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s only half of it here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was indeed a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was all there was,&rsquo; said Anthea, with timid firmness. She knew it was
      not her fault. &lsquo;There should be another piece,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;and a
      sort of pin to fasten the two together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t half any good?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it work without the other bit?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It
      cost seven-and-six.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, bother, bother, bother!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      silly little idiots!&rsquo; said everyone and the Psammead altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a wretched silence. Cyril broke it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall we do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go back to the shop and see if they haven&rsquo;t got the other half,&rsquo; said the
      Psammead. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to sand till you come back. Cheer up! Even the bit
      you&rsquo;ve got is SOME good, but it&rsquo;ll be no end of a bother if you can&rsquo;t find
      the other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Cyril went to the shop. And the Psammead to sand. And the other three
      went to dinner, which was now ready. And old Nurse was very cross that
      Cyril was not ready too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three were watching at the windows when Cyril returned, and even
      before he was near enough for them to see his face there was something
      about the slouch of his shoulders and set of his knickerbockers and the
      way he dragged his boots along that showed but too plainly that his errand
      had been in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; they all said, hoping against hope on the front-door step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No go,&rsquo; Cyril answered; &lsquo;the man said the thing was perfect. He said it
      was a Roman lady&rsquo;s locket, and people shouldn&rsquo;t buy curios if they didn&rsquo;t
      know anything about arky&mdash;something or other, and that he never went
      back on a bargain, because it wasn&rsquo;t business, and he expected his
      customers to act the same. He was simply nasty&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he was,
      and I want my dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that Cyril was not pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unlikeliness of anything really interesting happening in that parlour
      lay like a weight of lead on everyone&rsquo;s spirits. Cyril had his dinner, and
      just as he was swallowing the last mouthful of apple-pudding there was a
      scratch at the door. Anthea opened it and in walked the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; it said, when it had heard the news, &lsquo;things might be worse. Only
      you won&rsquo;t be surprised if you have a few adventures before you get the
      other half. You want to get it, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather,&rsquo; was the general reply. &lsquo;And we don&rsquo;t mind adventures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;I seem to remember that about you. Well, sit
      down and listen with all your ears. Eight, are there? Right&mdash;I am
      glad you know arithmetic. Now pay attention, because I don&rsquo;t intend to
      tell you everything twice over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the children settled themselves on the floor&mdash;it was far more
      comfortable than the chairs, as well as more polite to the Psammead, who
      was stroking its whiskers on the hearth-rug&mdash;a sudden cold pain
      caught at Anthea&rsquo;s heart. Father&mdash;Mother&mdash;the darling Lamb&mdash;all
      far away. Then a warm, comfortable feeling flowed through her. The
      Psammead was here, and at least half a charm, and there were to be
      adventures. (If you don&rsquo;t know what a cold pain is, I am glad for your
      sakes, and I hope you never may.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the Psammead cheerily, &lsquo;you are not particularly nice, nor
      particularly clever, and you&rsquo;re not at all good-looking. Still, you&rsquo;ve
      saved my life&mdash;oh, when I think of that man and his pail of water!&mdash;so
      I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know. At least, of course I can&rsquo;t do that, because I
      know far too much. But I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know about this red thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do! Do! Do! Do!&rsquo; said everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said the Psammead. &lsquo;This thing is half of an Amulet that can
      do all sorts of things; it can make the corn grow, and the waters flow,
      and the trees bear fruit, and the little new beautiful babies come. (Not
      that babies ARE beautiful, of course,&rsquo; it broke off to say, &lsquo;but their
      mothers think they are&mdash;and as long as you think a thing&rsquo;s true it IS
      true as far as you&rsquo;re concerned.)&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The complete Amulet can keep off all the things that make people unhappy&mdash;jealousy,
      bad temper, pride, disagreeableness, greediness, selfishness, laziness.
      Evil spirits, people called them when the Amulet was made. Don&rsquo;t you think
      it would be nice to have it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said the children, quite without enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it can give you strength and courage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And virtue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s nice to have that,&rsquo; said Jane, but not with much interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it can give you your heart&rsquo;s desire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I am,&rsquo; retorted the Psammead tartly, &lsquo;so there&rsquo;s no need for
      you to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heart&rsquo;s desire is good enough for me,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but,&rsquo; Anthea ventured, &lsquo;all that&rsquo;s what the WHOLE charm can do.
      There&rsquo;s something that the half we&rsquo;ve got can win off its own bat&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      there?&rsquo; She appealed to the Psammead. It nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; it said; &lsquo;the half has the power to take you anywhere you like to
      look for the other half.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed a brilliant prospect till Robert asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does it know where to look?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead shook its head and answered, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;we might as well look for a needle in a bottle of
      hay. Yes&mdash;it IS bottle, and not bundle, Father said so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said the Psammead briskly-, &lsquo;you think you know everything,
      but you are quite mistaken. The first thing is to get the thing to talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can it?&rsquo; Jane questioned. Jane&rsquo;s question did not mean that she thought
      it couldn&rsquo;t, for in spite of the parlour furniture the feeling of magic
      was growing deeper and thicker, and seemed to fill the room like a dream
      of a scented fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it can. I suppose you can read.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes!&rsquo; Everyone was rather hurt at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then&mdash;all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to read the name that&rsquo;s written
      on the part of the charm that you&rsquo;ve got. And as soon as you say the name
      out loud the thing will have power to do&mdash;well, several things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. The red charm was passed from hand to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no name on it,&rsquo; said Cyril at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said the Psammead; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, THAT!&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not reading. It looks like pictures of
      chickens and snakes and things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what was on the charm: [Hieroglyphics omitted.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no patience with you,&rsquo; said the Psammead; &lsquo;if you can&rsquo;t read you
      must find some one who can. A priest now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know any priests,&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;we know a clergyman&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      called a priest in the prayer-book, you know&mdash;but he only knows Greek
      and Latin and Hebrew, and this isn&rsquo;t any of those&mdash;I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead stamped a furry foot angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never seen you,&rsquo; it said; &lsquo;you aren&rsquo;t any more good than so
      many stone images. Not so much, if I&rsquo;m to tell the truth. Is there no wise
      man in your Babylon who can pronounce the names of the Great Ones?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a poor learned gentleman upstairs,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;we might try
      him. He has a lot of stone images in his room, and iron-looking ones too&mdash;we
      peeped in once when he was out. Old Nurse says he doesn&rsquo;t eat enough to
      keep a canary alive. He spends it all on stones and things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try him,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;only be careful. If he knows a greater name
      than this and uses it against you, your charm will be of no use. Bind him
      first with the chains of honour and upright dealing. And then ask his aid&mdash;oh,
      yes, you&rsquo;d better all go; you can put me to sand as you go upstairs. I
      must have a few minutes&rsquo; peace and quietness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the four children hastily washed their hands and brushed their hair&mdash;this
      was Anthea&rsquo;s idea&mdash;and went up to knock at the door of the &lsquo;poor
      learned gentleman&rsquo;, and to &lsquo;bind him with the chains of honour and upright
      dealing&rsquo;.

      CHAPTER 3. THE PAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman had let his dinner get quite cold. It was mutton
      chop, and as it lay on the plate it looked like a brown island in the
      middle of a frozen pond, because the grease of the gravy had become cold,
      and consequently white. It looked very nasty, and it was the first thing
      the children saw when, after knocking three times and receiving no reply,
      one of them ventured to turn the handle and softly to open the door. The
      chop was on the end of a long table that ran down one side of the room.
      The table had images on it and queer-shaped stones, and books. And there
      were glass cases fixed against the wall behind, with little strange things
      in them. The cases were rather like the ones you see in jewellers&rsquo; shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;poor learned gentleman&rsquo; was sitting at a table in the window, looking
      at something very small which he held in a pair of fine pincers. He had a
      round spy-glass sort of thing in one eye&mdash;which reminded the children
      of watchmakers, and also of the long snail&rsquo;s eyes of the Psammead. The
      gentleman was very long and thin, and his long, thin boots stuck out under
      the other side of his table. He did not hear the door open, and the
      children stood hesitating. At last Robert gave the door a push, and they
      all started back, for in the middle of the wall that the door had hidden
      was a mummy-case&mdash;very, very, very big&mdash;painted in red and
      yellow and green and black, and the face of it seemed to look at them
      quite angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know what a mummy-case is like, of course? If you don&rsquo;t you had better
      go to the British Museum at once and find out. Anyway, it is not at all
      the sort of thing that you expect to meet in a top-floor front in
      Bloomsbury, looking as though it would like to know what business YOU had
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      So everyone said, &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; rather loud, and their boots clattered as they
      stumbled back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman took the glass out of his eye and said&mdash;&lsquo;I beg
      your pardon,&rsquo; in a very soft, quiet pleasant voice&mdash;the voice of a
      gentleman who has been to Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s us that beg yours,&rsquo; said Cyril politely. &lsquo;We are sorry to disturb
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said the gentleman, rising&mdash;with the most distinguished
      courtesy, Anthea told herself. &lsquo;I am delighted to see you. Won&rsquo;t you sit
      down? No, not there; allow me to move that papyrus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared a chair, and stood smiling and looking kindly through his
      large, round spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He treats us like grown-ups,&rsquo; whispered Robert, &lsquo;and he doesn&rsquo;t seem to
      know how many of us there are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t manners to whisper. You say, Cyril&mdash;go
      ahead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry to disturb you,&rsquo; said Cyril politely, &lsquo;but we did knock
      three times, and you didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Come in&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Run away now&rdquo;, or that you
      couldn&rsquo;t be bothered just now, or to come when you weren&rsquo;t so busy, or any
      of the things people do say when you knock at doors, so we opened it. We
      knew you were in because we heard you sneeze while we were waiting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said the gentleman; &lsquo;do sit down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has found out there are four of us,&rsquo; said Robert, as the gentleman
      cleared three more chairs. He put the things off them carefully on the
      floor. The first chair had things like bricks that tiny, tiny birds&rsquo; feet
      have walked over when the bricks were soft, only the marks were in regular
      lines. The second chair had round things on it like very large, fat, long,
      pale beads. And the last chair had a pile of dusty papers on it. The
      children sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We know you are very, very learned,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;and we have got a
      charm, and we want you to read the name on it, because it isn&rsquo;t in Latin
      or Greek, or Hebrew, or any of the languages WE know&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A thorough knowledge of even those languages is a very fair foundation on
      which to build an education,&rsquo; said the gentleman politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Cyril blushing, &lsquo;but we only know them to look at, except Latin&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;m only in Caesar with that.&rsquo; The gentleman took off his spectacles and
      laughed. His laugh sounded rusty, Cyril thought, as though it wasn&rsquo;t often
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your pardon. I think I must have
      been in a dream. You are the children who live downstairs, are you not?
      Yes. I have seen you as I have passed in and out. And you have found
      something that you think to be an antiquity, and you&rsquo;ve brought it to show
      me? That was very kind. I should like to inspect it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we didn&rsquo;t think about your liking to inspect it,&rsquo; said the
      truthful Anthea. &lsquo;It was just for US because we wanted to know the name on
      it&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes&mdash;and, I say,&rsquo; Robert interjected, &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t think it rude
      of us if we ask you first, before we show it, to be bound in the
      what-do-you-call-it of&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the bonds of honour and upright dealing,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t quite follow you,&rsquo; said the gentleman, with gentle
      nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got part of a charm. And the
      Sammy&mdash;I mean, something told us it would work, though it&rsquo;s only half
      a one; but it won&rsquo;t work unless we can say the name that&rsquo;s on it. But, of
      course, if you&rsquo;ve got another name that can lick ours, our charm will be
      no go; so we want you to give us your word of honour as a gentleman&mdash;though
      I&rsquo;m sure, now I&rsquo;ve seen you, that it&rsquo;s not necessary; but still I&rsquo;ve
      promised to ask you, so we must. Will you please give us your honourable
      word not to say any name stronger than the name on our charm?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman had put on his spectacles again and was looking at Cyril
      through them. He now said: &lsquo;Bless me!&rsquo; more than once, adding, &lsquo;Who told
      you all this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some faint memory of a far-off childhood must have come to the learned
      gentleman just then, for he smiled. &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It is some sort of
      game that you are engaged in? Of course! Yes! Well, I will certainly
      promise. Yet I wonder how you heard of the names of power?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t tell you that either,&rsquo; said Cyril; and Anthea said, &lsquo;Here is our
      charm,&rsquo; and held it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      With politeness, but without interest, the gentleman took it. But after
      the first glance all his body suddenly stiffened, as a pointer&rsquo;s does when
      he sees a partridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; he said in quite a changed voice, and carried the charm to
      the window. He looked at it; he turned it over. He fixed his spy-glass in
      his eye and looked again. No one said anything. Only Robert made a
      shuffling noise with his feet till Anthea nudged him to shut up. At last
      the learned gentleman drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did you find this?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t find it. We bought it at a shop. Jacob Absalom the name is&mdash;not
      far from Charing Cross,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We gave seven-and-sixpence for it,&rsquo; added Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not for sale, I suppose? You do not wish to part with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to tell you that it is extremely valuable&mdash;extraordinarily
      valuable, I may say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;we know that, so of course we want to keep it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep it carefully, then,&rsquo; said the gentleman impressively; &lsquo;and if ever
      you should wish to part with it, may I ask you to give me the refusal of
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The refusal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean, do not sell it to anyone else until you have given me the
      opportunity of buying it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;we won&rsquo;t. But we don&rsquo;t want to sell it. We want
      to make it do things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you can play at that as well as at anything else,&rsquo; said the
      gentleman; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid the days of magic are over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They aren&rsquo;t REALLY,&rsquo; said Anthea earnestly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d see they aren&rsquo;t if I
      could tell you about our last summer holidays. Only I mustn&rsquo;t. Thank you
      very much. And can you read the name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I can read it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you tell it us?&rsquo; &lsquo;The name,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;is Ur Hekau
      Setcheh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ur Hekau Setcheh,&rsquo; repeated Cyril. &lsquo;Thanks awfully. I do hope we haven&rsquo;t
      taken up too much of your time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;And do let me entreat you to be very,
      very careful of that most valuable specimen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They said &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; in all the different polite ways they could think
      of, and filed out of the door and down the stairs. Anthea was last.
      Half-way down to the first landing she turned and ran up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was still open, and the learned gentleman and the mummy-case were
      standing opposite to each other, and both looked as though they had stood
      like that for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman started when Anthea put her hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be cross and say it&rsquo;s not my business,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but
      do look at your chop! Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to eat it? Father forgets
      his dinner sometimes when he&rsquo;s writing, and Mother always says I ought to
      remind him if she&rsquo;s not at home to do it herself, because it&rsquo;s so bad to
      miss your regular meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I thought perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind my reminding you, because you don&rsquo;t
      seem to have anyone else to do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the mummy-case; IT certainly did not look as though it
      would ever think of reminding people of their meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman looked at her for a moment before he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, my dear. It was a kindly thought. No, I haven&rsquo;t anyone to
      remind me about things like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and looked at the chop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It looks very nasty,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it does. I&rsquo;ll eat it immediately, before I forget.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ate it he sighed more than once. Perhaps because the chop was nasty,
      perhaps because he longed for the charm which the children did not want to
      sell, perhaps because it was so long since anyone cared whether he ate his
      chops or forgot them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea caught the others at the stair-foot. They woke the Psammead, and it
      taught them exactly how to use the word of power, and to make the charm
      speak. I am not going to tell you how this is done, because you might try
      to do it. And for you any such trying would be almost sure to end in
      disappointment. Because in the first place it is a thousand million to one
      against your ever getting hold of the right sort of charm, and if you did,
      there would be hardly any chance at all of your finding a learned
      gentleman clever enough and kind enough to read the word for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children and the Psammead crouched in a circle on the floor&mdash;in
      the girls&rsquo; bedroom, because in the parlour they might have been
      interrupted by old Nurse&rsquo;s coming in to lay the cloth for tea&mdash;and
      the charm was put in the middle of the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun shone splendidly outside, and the room was very light. Through the
      open window came the hum and rattle of London, and in the street below
      they could hear the voice of the milkman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was ready, the Psammead signed to Anthea to say the word. And she
      said it. Instantly the whole light of all the world seemed to go out. The
      room was dark. The world outside was dark&mdash;darker than the darkest
      night that ever was. And all the sounds went out too, so that there was a
      silence deeper than any silence you have ever even dreamed of imagining.
      It was like being suddenly deaf and blind, only darker and quieter even
      than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the children had got over the sudden shock of it enough to be
      frightened, a faint, beautiful light began to show in the middle of the
      circle, and at the same moment a faint, beautiful voice began to speak.
      The light was too small for one to see anything by, and the voice was too
      small for you to hear what it said. You could just see the light and just
      hear the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the light grew stronger. It was greeny, like glow-worms&rsquo; lamps, and it
      grew and grew till it was as though thousands and thousands of glow-worms
      were signalling to their winged sweethearts from the middle of the circle.
      And the voice grew, not so much in loudness as in sweetness (though it
      grew louder, too), till it was so sweet that you wanted to cry with
      pleasure just at the sound of it. It was like nightingales, and the sea,
      and the fiddle, and the voice of your mother when you have been a long
      time away, and she meets you at the door when you get home.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the voice said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak. What is it that you would hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot tell you what language the voice used. I only know that everyone
      present understood it perfectly. If you come to think of it, there must be
      some language that everyone could understand, if we only knew what it was.
      Nor can I tell you how the charm spoke, nor whether it was the charm that
      spoke, or some presence in the charm. The children could not have told you
      either. Indeed, they could not look at the charm while it was speaking,
      because the light was too bright. They looked instead at the green
      radiance on the faded Kidderminster carpet at the edge of the circle. They
      all felt very quiet, and not inclined to ask questions or fidget with
      their feet. For this was not like the things that had happened in the
      country when the Psammead had given them their wishes. That had been funny
      somehow, and this was not. It was something like Arabian Nights magic, and
      something like being in church. No one cared to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Cyril who said at last&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please we want to know where the other half of the charm is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The part of the Amulet which is lost,&rsquo; said the beautiful voice, &lsquo;was
      broken and ground into the dust of the shrine that held it. It and the pin
      that joined the two halves are themselves dust, and the dust is scattered
      over many lands and sunk in many seas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I say!&rsquo; murmured Robert, and a blank silence fell. &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s all
      up?&rsquo; said Cyril at last; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no use our looking for a thing that&rsquo;s
      smashed into dust, and the dust scattered all over the place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you would find it,&rsquo; said the voice, &lsquo;You must seek it where it still
      is, perfect as ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the Past you may find it,&rsquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we MAY find it,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead whispered crossly, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? The thing existed
      in the Past. If you were in the Past, too, you could find it. It&rsquo;s very
      difficult to make you understand things. Time and space are only forms of
      thought.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t,
      either. What I mean is that if you were only made the right way, you could
      see everything happening in the same place at the same time. Now do you
      see?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m so stupid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, at any rate, you see this. That lost half of the Amulet is in the
      Past. Therefore it&rsquo;s in the Past we must look for it. I mustn&rsquo;t speak to
      the charm myself. Ask it things! Find out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where can we find the other part of you?&rsquo; asked Cyril obediently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the Past,&rsquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What part of the Past?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may not tell you. If you will choose a time, I will take you to the
      place that then held it. You yourselves must find it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When did you see it last?&rsquo; asked Anthea&mdash;&lsquo;I mean, when was it taken
      away from you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful voice answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was thousands of years ago. The Amulet was perfect then, and lay in
      a shrine, the last of many shrines, and I worked wonders. Then came
      strange men with strange weapons and destroyed my shrine, and the Amulet
      they bore away with many captives. But of these, one, my priest, knew the
      word of power, and spoke it for me, so that the Amulet became invisible,
      and thus returned to my shrine, but the shrine was broken down, and ere
      any magic could rebuild it one spoke a word before which my power bowed
      down and was still. And the Amulet lay there, still perfect, but enslaved.
      Then one coming with stones to rebuild the shrine, dropped a hewn stone on
      the Amulet as it lay, and one half was sundered from the other. I had no
      power to seek for that which was lost. And there being none to speak the
      word of power, I could not rejoin it. So the Amulet lay in the dust of the
      desert many thousand years, and at last came a small man, a conqueror with
      an army, and after him a crowd of men who sought to seem wise, and one of
      these found half the Amulet and brought it to this land. But none could
      read the name. So I lay still. And this man dying and his son after him,
      the Amulet was sold by those who came after to a merchant, and from him
      you bought it, and it is here, and now, the name of power having been
      spoken, I also am here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what the voice said. I think it must have meant Napoleon by the
      small man, the conqueror. Because I know I have been told that he took an
      army to Egypt, and that afterwards a lot of wise people went grubbing in
      the sand, and fished up all sorts of wonderful things, older than you
      would think possible. And of these I believe this charm to have been one,
      and the most wonderful one of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone listened: and everyone tried to think. It is not easy to do this
      clearly when you have been listening to the kind of talk I have told you
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Robert said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you take us into the Past&mdash;to the shrine where you and the other
      thing were together. If you could take us there, we might find the other
      part still there after all these thousands of years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still there? silly!&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, if we go back into the
      Past it won&rsquo;t be thousands of years ago. It will be NOW for us&mdash;won&rsquo;t
      it?&rsquo; He appealed to the Psammead, who said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not so far off the idea as you usually are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;will you take us back to when there was a shrine and
      you were safe in it&mdash;all of you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the voice. &lsquo;You must hold me up, and speak the word of power,
      and one by one, beginning with the first-born, you shall pass through me
      into the Past. But let the last that passes be the one that holds me, and
      let him not lose his hold, lest you lose me, and so remain in the Past for
      ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a nasty idea,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you desire to return,&rsquo; the beautiful voice went on, &lsquo;hold me up
      towards the East, and speak the word. Then, passing through me, you shall
      return to this time and it shall be the present to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how&mdash;&rsquo; A bell rang loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh crikey!&rsquo; exclaimed Robert, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s tea! Will you please make it proper
      daylight again so that we can go down. And thank you so much for all your
      kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve enjoyed ourselves very much indeed, thank you!&rsquo; added Anthea
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful light faded slowly. The great darkness and silence came and
      these suddenly changed to the dazzlement of day and the great soft,
      rustling sound of London, that is like some vast beast turning over in its
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children rubbed their eyes, the Psammead ran quickly to its sandy
      bath, and the others went down to tea. And until the cups were actually
      filled tea seemed less real than the beautiful voice and the greeny light.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea Anthea persuaded the others to allow her to hang the charm round
      her neck with a piece of string.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be so awful if it got lost,&rsquo; she said: &lsquo;it might get lost
      anywhere, you know, and it would be rather beastly for us to have to stay
      in the Past for ever and ever, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4. EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS AGO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning Anthea got old Nurse to allow her to take up the &lsquo;poor
      learned gentleman&rsquo;s&rsquo; breakfast. He did not recognize her at first, but
      when he did he was vaguely pleased to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see I&rsquo;m wearing the charm round my neck,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m taking care
      of it&mdash;like you told us to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;did you have a good game last night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will eat your breakfast before it&rsquo;s cold, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Anthea.
      &lsquo;Yes, we had a splendid time. The charm made it all dark, and then greeny
      light, and then it spoke. Oh! I wish you could have heard it&mdash;it was
      such a darling voice&mdash;and it told us the other half of it was lost in
      the Past, so of course we shall have to look for it there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman rubbed his hair with both hands and looked anxiously
      at Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s natural&mdash;youthful imagination and so forth,&rsquo; he said.
      &lsquo;Yet someone must have... Who told you that some part of the charm was
      missing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I know it seems most awfully rude,
      especially after being so kind about telling us the name of power, and all
      that, but really, I&rsquo;m not allowed to tell anybody anything about the&mdash;the&mdash;the
      person who told me. You won&rsquo;t forget your breakfast, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman smiled feebly and then frowned&mdash;not a
      cross-frown, but a puzzle-frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I shall always be pleased if you&rsquo;ll look in&mdash;any
      time you&rsquo;re passing you know&mdash;at least...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;goodbye. I&rsquo;ll always tell you anything I MAY tell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not had many adventures with children in them, and he wondered
      whether all children were like these. He spent quite five minutes in
      wondering before he settled down to the fifty-second chapter of his great
      book on &lsquo;The Secret Rites of the Priests of Amen Ra&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no use to pretend that the children did not feel a good deal of
      agitation at the thought of going through the charm into the Past. That
      idea, that perhaps they might stay in the Past and never get back again,
      was anything but pleasing. Yet no one would have dared to suggest that the
      charm should not be used; and though each was in its heart very frightened
      indeed, they would all have joined in jeering at the cowardice of any one
      of them who should have uttered the timid but natural suggestion, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      let&rsquo;s!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed necessary to make arrangements for being out all day, for there
      was no reason to suppose that the sound of the dinner-bell would be able
      to reach back into the Past, and it seemed unwise to excite old Nurse&rsquo;s
      curiosity when nothing they could say&mdash;not even the truth&mdash;could
      in any way satisfy it. They were all very proud to think how well they had
      understood what the charm and the Psammead had said about Time and Space
      and things like that, and they were perfectly certain that it would be
      quite impossible to make old Nurse understand a single word of it. So they
      merely asked her to let them take their dinner out into Regent&rsquo;s Park&mdash;and
      this, with the implied cold mutton and tomatoes, was readily granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can get yourselves some buns or sponge-cakes, or whatever you
      fancy-like,&rsquo; said old Nurse, giving Cyril a shilling. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go getting
      jam-tarts, now&mdash;so messy at the best of times, and without forks and
      plates ruination to your clothes, besides your not being able to wash your
      hands and faces afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Cyril took the shilling, and they all started off. They went round by
      the Tottenham Court Road to buy a piece of waterproof sheeting to put over
      the Psammead in case it should be raining in the Past when they got there.
      For it is almost certain death to a Psammead to get wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was shining very brightly, and even London looked pretty. Women
      were selling roses from big baskets-full, and Anthea bought four roses,
      one each, for herself and the others. They were red roses and smelt of
      summer&mdash;the kind of roses you always want so desperately at about
      Christmas-time when you can only get mistletoe, which is pale right
      through to its very scent, and holly which pricks your nose if you try to
      smell it. So now everyone had a rose in its buttonhole, and soon everyone
      was sitting on the grass in Regent&rsquo;s Park under trees whose leaves would
      have been clean, clear green in the country, but here were dusty and
      yellowish, and brown at the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go on with it,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;and as the eldest has to go
      first, you&rsquo;ll have to be last, Jane. You quite understand about holding on
      to the charm as you go through, don&rsquo;t you, Pussy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t got to be last,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall carry the Psammead if you like,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;That is,&rsquo; she
      added, remembering the beast&rsquo;s queer temper, &lsquo;if it&rsquo;ll let you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead, however, was unexpectedly amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;who carries me, so long as it doesn&rsquo;t
      drop me. I can&rsquo;t bear being dropped.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane with trembling hands took the Psammead and its fish-basket under one
      arm. The charm&rsquo;s long string was hung round her neck. Then they all stood
      up. Jane held out the charm at arm&rsquo;s length, and Cyril solemnly pronounced
      the word of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke it the charm grew tall and broad, and he saw that Jane was
      just holding on to the edge of a great red arch of very curious shape. The
      opening of the arch was small, but Cyril saw that he could go through it.
      All round and beyond the arch were the faded trees and trampled grass of
      Regent&rsquo;s Park, where the little ragged children were playing
      Ring-o&rsquo;-Roses. But through the opening of it shone a blaze of blue and
      yellow and red. Cyril drew a long breath and stiffened his legs so that
      the others should not see that his knees were trembling and almost
      knocking together. &lsquo;Here goes!&rsquo; he said, and, stepping up through the
      arch, disappeared. Then followed Anthea. Robert, coming next, held fast,
      at Anthea&rsquo;s suggestion, to the sleeve of Jane, who was thus dragged safely
      through the arch. And as soon as they were on the other side of the arch
      there was no more arch at all and no more Regent&rsquo;s Park either, only the
      charm in Jane&rsquo;s hand, and it was its proper size again. They were now in a
      light so bright that they winked and blinked and rubbed their eyes. During
      this dazzling interval Anthea felt for the charm and pushed it inside
      Jane&rsquo;s frock, so that it might be quite safe. When their eyes got used to
      the new wonderful light the children looked around them. The sky was very,
      very blue, and it sparkled and glittered and dazzled like the sea at home
      when the sun shines on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing on a little clearing in a thick, low forest; there were
      trees and shrubs and a close, thorny, tangly undergrowth. In front of them
      stretched a bank of strange black mud, then came the browny-yellowy
      shining ribbon of a river. Then more dry, caked mud and more greeny-browny
      jungle. The only things that told that human people had been there were
      the clearing, a path that led to it, and an odd arrangement of cut reeds
      in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;this IS a change of air!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was. The air was hotter than they could have imagined, even in London
      in August.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I knew where we were,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a river, now&mdash;I wonder whether it&rsquo;s the Amazon or the Tiber,
      or what.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the Nile,&rsquo; said the Psammead, looking out of the fish-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then this is Egypt,&rsquo; said Robert, who had once taken a geography prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any crocodiles,&rsquo; Cyril objected. His prize had been for
      natural history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead reached out a hairy arm from its basket and pointed to a heap
      of mud at the edge of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you call that?&rsquo; it said; and as it spoke the heap of mud slid
      into the river just as a slab of damp mixed mortar will slip from a
      bricklayer&rsquo;s trowel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a crashing among the reeds on the other side of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And there&rsquo;s a river-horse!&rsquo; said the Psammead, as a great beast like an
      enormous slaty-blue slug showed itself against the black bank on the far
      side of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a hippopotamus,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;it seems much more real somehow than
      the one at the Zoo, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s being real on the other side of the river,&rsquo; said Jane. And
      now there was a crackling of reeds and twigs behind them. This was
      horrible. Of course it might be another hippopotamus, or a crocodile, or a
      lion&mdash;or, in fact, almost anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep your hand on the charm, Jane,&rsquo; said Robert hastily. &lsquo;We ought to
      have a means of escape handy. I&rsquo;m dead certain this is the sort of place
      where simply anything might happen to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe a hippopotamus is going to happen to us,&rsquo; said Jane&mdash;&lsquo;a
      very, very big one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had all turned to face the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly little duffers,&rsquo; said the Psammead in its friendly,
      informal way; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not a river-horse. It&rsquo;s a human.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was. It was a girl&mdash;of about Anthea&rsquo;s age. Her hair was short and
      fair, and though her skin was tanned by the sun, you could see that it
      would have been fair too if it had had a chance. She had every chance of
      being tanned, for she had no clothes to speak of, and the four English
      children, carefully dressed in frocks, hats, shoes, stockings, coats,
      collars, and all the rest of it, envied her more than any words of theirs
      or of mine could possibly say. There was no doubt that here was the right
      costume for that climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried a pot on her head, of red and black earthenware. She did not
      see the children, who shrank back against the edge of the jungle, and she
      went forward to the brink of the river to fill her pitcher. As she went
      she made a strange sort of droning, humming, melancholy noise all on two
      notes. Anthea could not help thinking that perhaps the girl thought this
      noise was singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl filled the pitcher and set it down by the river bank. Then she
      waded into the water and stooped over the circle of cut reeds. She pulled
      half a dozen fine fish out of the water within the reeds, killing each as
      she took it out, and threading it on a long osier that she carried. Then
      she knotted the osier, hung it on her arm, picked up the pitcher, and
      turned to come back. And as she turned she saw the four children. The
      white dresses of Jane and Anthea stood out like snow against the dark
      forest background. She screamed and the pitcher fell, and the water was
      spilled out over the hard mud surface and over the fish, which had fallen
      too. Then the water slowly trickled away into the deep cracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; Anthea cried, &lsquo;we won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, once for all, I am not going to be bothered to tell you how it was
      that the girl could understand Anthea and Anthea could understand the
      girl. YOU, at any rate, would not understand ME, if I tried to explain it,
      any more than you can understand about time and space being only forms of
      thought. You may think what you like. Perhaps the children had found out
      the universal language which everyone can understand, and which wise men
      so far have not found. You will have noticed long ago that they were
      singularly lucky children, and they may have had this piece of luck as
      well as others. Or it may have been that... but why pursue the question
      further? The fact remains that in all their adventures the muddle-headed
      inventions which we call foreign languages never bothered them in the
      least. They could always understand and be understood. If you can explain
      this, please do. I daresay I could understand your explanation, though you
      could never understand mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when the girl said, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; everyone understood at once, and
      Anthea replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are children&mdash;just like you. Don&rsquo;t be frightened. Won&rsquo;t you show
      us where you live?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane put her face right into the Psammead&rsquo;s basket, and burrowed her mouth
      into its fur to whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it safe? Won&rsquo;t they eat us? Are they cannibals?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead shrugged its fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make your voice buzz like that, it tickles my ears,&rsquo; it said rather
      crossly. &lsquo;You can always get back to Regent&rsquo;s Park in time if you keep
      fast hold of the charm,&rsquo; it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange girl was trembling with fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea had a bangle on her arm. It was a sevenpenny-halfpenny trumpery
      thing that pretended to be silver; it had a glass heart of turquoise blue
      hanging from it, and it was the gift of the maid-of-all-work at the
      Fitzroy Street house. &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;this is for you. That is to
      show we will not hurt you. And if you take it I shall know that you won&rsquo;t
      hurt us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl held out her hand. Anthea slid the bangle over it, and the girl&rsquo;s
      face lighted up with the joy of possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; she said, looking lovingly at the bangle; &lsquo;it is peace between
      your house and mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up her fish and pitcher and led the way up the narrow path by
      which she had come and the others followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is something like!&rsquo; said Cyril, trying to be brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; said Robert, also assuming a boldness he was far from feeling,
      &lsquo;this really and truly IS an adventure! Its being in the Past makes it
      quite different from the Phoenix and Carpet happenings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The belt of thick-growing acacia trees and shrubs&mdash;mostly prickly and
      unpleasant-looking&mdash;seemed about half a mile across. The path was
      narrow and the wood dark. At last, ahead, daylight shone through the
      boughs and leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole party suddenly came out of the wood&rsquo;s shadow into the glare of
      the sunlight that shone on a great stretch of yellow sand, dotted with
      heaps of grey rocks where spiky cactus plants showed gaudy crimson and
      pink flowers among their shabby, sand-peppered leaves. Away to the right
      was something that looked like a grey-brown hedge, and from beyond it blue
      smoke went up to the bluer sky. And over all the sun shone till you could
      hardly bear your clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is where I live,&rsquo; said the girl pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; whispered Jane into the basket, &lsquo;unless you say it&rsquo;s all
      right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead ought to have been touched by this proof of confidence.
      Perhaps, however, it looked upon it as a proof of doubt, for it merely
      snarled&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t go now I&rsquo;ll never help you again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;OH,&rsquo; whispered Anthea, &lsquo;dear Jane, don&rsquo;t! Think of Father and Mother and
      all of us getting our heart&rsquo;s desire. And we can go back any minute. Come
      on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; said Cyril, in a low voice, &lsquo;the Psammead must know there&rsquo;s no
      danger or it wouldn&rsquo;t go. It&rsquo;s not so over and above brave itself. Come
      on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This Jane at last consented to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they got nearer to the browny fence they saw that it was a great hedge
      about eight feet high, made of piled-up thorn bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rsquo; asked Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To keep out foes and wild beasts,&rsquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think it ought to, too,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Why, some of the thorns are
      as long as my foot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an opening in the hedge, and they followed the girl through it.
      A little way further on was another hedge, not so high, also of dry thorn
      bushes, very prickly and spiteful-looking, and within this was a sort of
      village of huts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no gardens and no roads. Just huts built of wood and twigs and
      clay, and roofed with great palm-leaves, dumped down anywhere. The doors
      of these houses were very low, like the doors of dog-kennels. The ground
      between them was not paths or streets, but just yellow sand trampled very
      hard and smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the village there was a hedge that enclosed what seemed
      to be a piece of ground about as big as their own garden in Camden Town.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner were the children well within the inner thorn hedge than dozens
      of men and women and children came crowding round from behind and inside
      the huts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood protectingly in front of the four children, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are wonder-children from beyond the desert. They bring marvellous
      gifts, and I have said that it is peace between us and them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her arm with the Lowther Arcade bangle on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children from London, where nothing now surprises anyone, had never
      before seen so many people look so astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crowded round the children, touching their clothes, their shoes, the
      buttons on the boys&rsquo; jackets, and the coral of the girls&rsquo; necklaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do say something,&rsquo; whispered Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We come,&rsquo; said Cyril, with some dim remembrance of a dreadful day when he
      had had to wait in an outer office while his father interviewed a
      solicitor, and there had been nothing to read but the Daily Telegraph&mdash;&lsquo;we
      come from the world where the sun never sets. And peace with honour is
      what we want. We are the great Anglo-Saxon or conquering race. Not that we
      want to conquer YOU,&rsquo; he added hastily. &lsquo;We only want to look at your
      houses and your&mdash;well, at all you&rsquo;ve got here, and then we shall
      return to our own place, and tell of all that we have seen so that your
      name may be famed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril&rsquo;s speech didn&rsquo;t keep the crowd from pressing round and looking as
      eagerly as ever at the clothing of the children. Anthea had an idea that
      these people had never seen woven stuff before, and she saw how wonderful
      and strange it must seem to people who had never had any clothes but the
      skins of beasts. The sewing, too, of modern clothes seemed to astonish
      them very much. They must have been able to sew themselves, by the way,
      for men who seemed to be the chiefs wore knickerbockers of goat-skin or
      deer-skin, fastened round the waist with twisted strips of hide. And the
      women wore long skimpy skirts of animals&rsquo; skins. The people were not very
      tall, their hair was fair, and men and women both had it short. Their eyes
      were blue, and that seemed odd in Egypt. Most of them were tattooed like
      sailors, only more roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this? What is this?&rsquo; they kept asking touching the children&rsquo;s
      clothes curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea hastily took off Jane&rsquo;s frilly lace collar and handed it to the
      woman who seemed most friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take this,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and look at it. And leave us alone. We want to
      talk among ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in the tone of authority which she had always found successful
      when she had not time to coax her baby brother to do as he was told. The
      tone was just as successful now. The children were left together and the
      crowd retreated. It paused a dozen yards away to look at the lace collar
      and to go on talking as hard as it could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children will never know what those people said, though they knew well
      enough that they, the four strangers, were the subject of the talk. They
      tried to comfort themselves by remembering the girl&rsquo;s promise of
      friendliness, but of course the thought of the charm was more comfortable
      than anything else. They sat down on the sand in the shadow of the
      hedged-round place in the middle of the village, and now for the first
      time they were able to look about them and to see something more than a
      crowd of eager, curious faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      They here noticed that the women wore necklaces made of beads of different
      coloured stone, and from these hung pendants of odd, strange shapes, and
      some of them had bracelets of ivory and flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;what a lot we could teach them if we stayed here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I expect they could teach us something too,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;Did you notice
      that flint bracelet the woman had that Anthea gave the collar to? That
      must have taken some making. Look here, they&rsquo;ll get suspicious if we talk
      among ourselves, and I do want to know about how they do things. Let&rsquo;s get
      the girl to show us round, and we can be thinking about how to get the
      Amulet at the same time. Only mind, we must keep together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea beckoned to the girl, who was standing a little way off looking
      wistfully at them, and she came gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell us how you make the bracelets, the stone ones,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With other stones,&rsquo; said the girl; &lsquo;the men make them; we have men of
      special skill in such work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any iron tools?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Iron,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rsquo; It was the first word
      she had not understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are all your tools of flint?&rsquo; asked Cyril. &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said the girl,
      opening her eyes wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I had time to tell you of that talk. The English children wanted to
      hear all about this new place, but they also wanted to tell of their own
      country. It was like when you come back from your holidays and you want to
      hear and to tell everything at the same time. As the talk went on there
      were more and more words that the girl could not understand, and the
      children soon gave up the attempt to explain to her what their own country
      was like, when they began to see how very few of the things they had
      always thought they could not do without were really not at all necessary
      to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl showed them how the huts were made&mdash;indeed, as one was being
      made that very day she took them to look at it. The way of building was
      very different from ours. The men stuck long pieces of wood into a piece
      of ground the size of the hut they wanted to make. These were about eight
      inches apart; then they put in another row about eight inches away from
      the first, and then a third row still further out. Then all the space
      between was filled up with small branches and twigs, and then daubed over
      with black mud worked with the feet till it was soft and sticky like
      putty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl told them how the men went hunting with flint spears and arrows,
      and how they made boats with reeds and clay. Then she explained the reed
      thing in the river that she had taken the fish out of. It was a fish-trap&mdash;just
      a ring of reeds set up in the water with only one little opening in it,
      and in this opening, just below the water, were stuck reeds slanting the
      way of the river&rsquo;s flow, so that the fish, when they had swum sillily in,
      sillily couldn&rsquo;t get out again. She showed them the clay pots and jars and
      platters, some of them ornamented with black and red patterns, and the
      most wonderful things made of flint and different sorts of stone, beads,
      and ornaments, and tools and weapons of all sorts and kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is really wonderful,&rsquo; said Cyril patronizingly, &lsquo;when you consider
      that it&rsquo;s all eight thousand years ago&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rsquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ISN&rsquo;T eight thousand years ago,&rsquo; whispered Jane. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s NOW&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s just what I don&rsquo;t like about it. I say, DO let&rsquo;s get home again
      before anything more happens. You can see for yourselves the charm isn&rsquo;t
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s in that place in the middle?&rsquo; asked Anthea, struck by a sudden
      thought, and pointing to the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the secret sacred place,&rsquo; said the girl in a whisper. &lsquo;No one
      knows what is there. There are many walls, and inside the insidest one IT
      is, but no one knows what IT is except the headsmen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe YOU know,&rsquo; said Cyril, looking at her very hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you this if you&rsquo;ll tell me,&rsquo; said Anthea taking off a bead-ring
      which had already been much admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the girl, catching eagerly at the ring. &lsquo;My father is one of
      the heads, and I know a water charm to make him talk in his sleep. And he
      has spoken. I will tell you. But if they know I have told you they will
      kill me. In the insidest inside there is a stone box, and in it there is
      the Amulet. None knows whence it came. It came from very far away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you seen it?&rsquo; asked Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it anything like this?&rsquo; asked Jane, rashly producing the charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s face turned a sickly greenish-white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hide it, hide it,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;You must put it back. If they see it
      they will kill us all. You for taking it, and me for knowing that there
      was such a thing. Oh, woe&mdash;woe! why did you ever come here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;They shan&rsquo;t know. Jane, don&rsquo;t you be
      such a little jack-ape again&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. You see what will happen if
      you do. Now, tell me&mdash;&rsquo; He turned to the girl, but before he had time
      to speak the question there was a loud shout, and a man bounded in through
      the opening in the thorn-hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many foes are upon us!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Make ready the defences!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His breath only served for that, and he lay panting on the ground. &lsquo;Oh, DO
      let&rsquo;s go home!&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;Look here&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I WILL!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up the charm. Fortunately all the strange, fair people were too
      busy to notice HER. She held up the charm. And nothing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t said the word of power,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane hastily said it&mdash;and still nothing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold it up towards the East, you silly!&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which IS the East?&rsquo; said Jane, dancing about in her agony of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody knew. So they opened the fish-bag to ask the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the bag had only a waterproof sheet in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hide the sacred thing! Hide it! Hide it!&rsquo; whispered the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril shrugged his shoulders, and tried to look as brave as he knew he
      ought to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hide it up, Pussy,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We are in for it now. We&rsquo;ve just got to
      stay and see it out.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5. THE FIGHT IN THE VILLAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here was a horrible position! Four English children, whose proper date was
      A.D. 1905, and whose proper address was London, set down in Egypt in the
      year 6000 B.C. with no means whatever of getting back into their own time
      and place. They could not find the East, and the sun was of no use at the
      moment, because some officious person had once explained to Cyril that the
      sun did not really set in the West at all&mdash;nor rise in the East
      either, for the matter of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead had crept out of the bass-bag when they were not looking and
      had basely deserted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      An enemy was approaching. There would be a fight. People get killed in
      fights, and the idea of taking part in a fight was one that did not appeal
      to the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had brought the news of the enemy still lay panting on the
      sand. His tongue was hanging out, long and red, like a dog&rsquo;s. The people
      of the village were hurriedly filling the gaps in the fence with
      thorn-bushes from the heap that seemed to have been piled there ready for
      just such a need. They lifted the cluster-thorns with long poles&mdash;much
      as men at home, nowadays, lift hay with a fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane bit her lip and tried to decide not to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert felt in his pocket for a toy pistol and loaded it with a pink paper
      cap. It was his only weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril tightened his belt two holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Anthea absently took the drooping red roses from the buttonholes of
      the others, bit the ends of the stalks, and set them in a pot of water
      that stood in the shadow by a hut door. She was always rather silly about
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I think perhaps the Psammead is really arranging
      something for us. I don&rsquo;t believe it would go away and leave us all alone
      in the Past. I&rsquo;m certain it wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane succeeded in deciding not to cry&mdash;at any rate yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what can we do?&rsquo; Robert asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; Cyril answered promptly, &lsquo;except keep our eyes and ears open.
      Look! That runner chap&rsquo;s getting his wind. Let&rsquo;s go and hear what he&rsquo;s got
      to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The runner had risen to his knees and was sitting back on his heels. Now
      he stood up and spoke. He began by some respectful remarks addressed to
      the heads of the village. His speech got more interesting when he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went out in my raft to snare ibises, and I had gone up the stream an
      hour&rsquo;s journey. Then I set my snares and waited. And I heard the sound of
      many wings, and looking up, saw many herons circling in the air. And I saw
      that they were afraid; so I took thought. A beast may scare one heron,
      coming upon it suddenly, but no beast will scare a whole flock of herons.
      And still they flew and circled, and would not light. So then I knew that
      what scared the herons must be men, and men who knew not our ways of going
      softly so as to take the birds and beasts unawares. By this I knew they
      were not of our race or of our place. So, leaving my raft, I crept along
      the river bank, and at last came upon the strangers. They are many as the
      sands of the desert, and their spear-heads shine red like the sun. They
      are a terrible people, and their march is towards US. Having seen this, I
      ran, and did not stay till I was before you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These are YOUR folk,&rsquo; said the headman, turning suddenly and angrily on
      Cyril, &lsquo;you came as spies for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We did NOT,&rsquo; said Cyril indignantly. &lsquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t be spies for anything.
      I&rsquo;m certain these people aren&rsquo;t a bit like us. Are they now?&rsquo; he asked the
      runner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;These men&rsquo;s faces were darkened, and their hair
      black as night. Yet these strange children, maybe, are their gods, who
      have come before to make ready the way for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur ran through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, NO,&rsquo; said Cyril again. &lsquo;We are on your side. We will help you to
      guard your sacred things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The headman seemed impressed by the fact that Cyril knew that there WERE
      sacred things to be guarded. He stood a moment gazing at the children.
      Then he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is well. And now let all make offering, that we may be strong in
      battle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd dispersed, and nine men, wearing antelope-skins, grouped
      themselves in front of the opening in the hedge in the middle of the
      village. And presently, one by one, the men brought all sorts of things&mdash;hippopotamus
      flesh, ostrich-feathers, the fruit of the date palms, red chalk, green
      chalk, fish from the river, and ibex from the mountains; and the headman
      received these gifts. There was another hedge inside the first, about a
      yard from it, so that there was a lane inside between the hedges. And
      every now and then one of the headmen would disappear along this lane with
      full hands and come back with hands empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re making offerings to their Amulet,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;We&rsquo;d better give
      something too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The pockets of the party, hastily explored, yielded a piece of pink tape,
      a bit of sealing-wax, and part of the Waterbury watch that Robert had not
      been able to help taking to pieces at Christmas and had never had time to
      rearrange. Most boys have a watch in this condition. They presented their
      offerings, and Anthea added the red roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The headman who took the things looked at them with awe, especially at the
      red roses and the Waterbury-watch fragment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a day of very wondrous happenings,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I have no more room
      in me to be astonished. Our maiden said there was peace between you and
      us. But for this coming of a foe we should have made sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now speak. Are you upon our side?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YES. Don&rsquo;t I keep telling you we are?&rsquo; Robert said. &lsquo;Look here. I will
      give you a sign. You see this.&rsquo; He held out the toy pistol. &lsquo;I shall speak
      to it, and if it answers me you will know that I and the others are come
      to guard your sacred thing&mdash;that we&rsquo;ve just made the offerings to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will that god whose image you hold in your hand speak to you alone, or
      shall I also hear it?&rsquo; asked the man cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised when you DO hear it,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;Now, then.&rsquo; He
      looked at the pistol and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we are to guard the sacred treasure within&rsquo;&mdash;he pointed to the
      hedged-in space&mdash;&lsquo;speak with thy loud voice, and we shall obey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled the trigger, and the cap went off. The noise was loud, for it
      was a two-shilling pistol, and the caps were excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man, woman, and child in the village fell on its face on the sand.
      The headman who had accepted the test rose first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The voice has spoken,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Lead them into the ante-room of the
      sacred thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So now the four children were led in through the opening of the hedge and
      round the lane till they came to an opening in the inner hedge, and they
      went through an opening in that, and so passed into another lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing was built something like this, and all the hedges were of
      brushwood and thorns: [Drawing of maze omitted.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like the maze at Hampton Court,&rsquo; whispered Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lanes were all open to the sky, but the little hut in the middle of
      the maze was round-roofed, and a curtain of skins hung over the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you may wait,&rsquo; said their guide, &lsquo;but do not dare to pass the
      curtain.&rsquo; He himself passed it and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But look here,&rsquo; whispered Cyril, &lsquo;some of us ought to be outside in case
      the Psammead turns up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s get separated from each other, whatever we do,&rsquo; said Anthea.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite bad enough to be separated from the Psammead. We can&rsquo;t do
      anything while that man is in there. Let&rsquo;s all go out into the village
      again. We can come back later now we know the way in. That man&rsquo;ll have to
      fight like the rest, most likely, if it comes to fighting. If we find the
      Psammead we&rsquo;ll go straight home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be getting late, and I don&rsquo;t much like this mazy place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out and told the headman that they would protect the treasure
      when the fighting began. And now they looked about them and were able to
      see exactly how a first-class worker in flint flakes and notches an
      arrow-head or the edge of an axe&mdash;an advantage which no other person
      now alive has ever enjoyed. The boys found the weapons most interesting.
      The arrow-heads were not on arrows such as you shoot from a bow, but on
      javelins, for throwing from the hand. The chief weapon was a stone
      fastened to a rather short stick something like the things gentlemen used
      to carry about and call life-preservers in the days of the garrotters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were long things like spears or lances, with flint knives&mdash;horribly
      sharp&mdash;and flint battle-axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone in the village was so busy that the place was like an ant-heap
      when you have walked into it by accident. The women were busy and even the
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite suddenly all the air seemed to glow and grow red&mdash;it was like
      the sudden opening of a furnace door, such as you may see at Woolwich
      Arsenal if you ever have the luck to be taken there&mdash;and then almost
      as suddenly it was as though the furnace doors had been shut. For the sun
      had set, and it was night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had that abrupt way of setting in Egypt eight thousand years ago,
      and I believe it has never been able to break itself of the habit, and
      sets in exactly the same manner to the present day. The girl brought the
      skins of wild deer and led the children to a heap of dry sedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father says they will not attack yet. Sleep!&rsquo; she said, and it really
      seemed a good idea. You may think that in the midst of all these dangers
      the children would not have been able to sleep&mdash;but somehow, though
      they were rather frightened now and then, the feeling was growing in them&mdash;deep
      down and almost hidden away, but still growing&mdash;that the Psammead was
      to be trusted, and that they were really and truly safe. This did not
      prevent their being quite as much frightened as they could bear to be
      without being perfectly miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d better go to sleep,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what on
      earth poor old Nurse will do with us out all night; set the police on our
      tracks, I expect. I only wish they could find us! A dozen policemen would
      be rather welcome just now. But it&rsquo;s no use getting into a stew over it,&rsquo; 
      he added soothingly. &lsquo;Good night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And they all fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were awakened by long, loud, terrible sounds that seemed to come from
      everywhere at once&mdash;horrible threatening shouts and shrieks and howls
      that sounded, as Cyril said later, like the voices of men thirsting for
      their enemies&rsquo; blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the voice of the strange men,&rsquo; said the girl, coming to them
      trembling through the dark. &lsquo;They have attacked the walls, and the thorns
      have driven them back. My father says they will not try again till
      daylight. But they are shouting to frighten us. As though we were savages!
      Dwellers in the swamps!&rsquo; she cried indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night the terrible noise went on, but when the sun rose, as abruptly
      as he had set, the sound suddenly ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children had hardly time to be glad of this before a shower of
      javelins came hurtling over the great thorn-hedge, and everyone sheltered
      behind the huts. But next moment another shower of weapons came from the
      opposite side, and the crowd rushed to other shelter. Cyril pulled out a
      javelin that had stuck in the roof of the hut beside him. Its head was of
      brightly burnished copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sound of shouting arose again and the crackle of dried thorns.
      The enemy was breaking down the hedge. All the villagers swarmed to the
      point whence the crackling and the shouting came; they hurled stones over
      the hedges, and short arrows with flint heads. The children had never
      before seen men with the fighting light in their eyes. It was very strange
      and terrible, and gave you a queer thick feeling in your throat; it was
      quite different from the pictures of fights in the illustrated papers at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that the shower of stones had driven back the besiegers. The
      besieged drew breath, but at that moment the shouting and the crackling
      arose on the opposite side of the village and the crowd hastened to defend
      that point, and so the fight swayed to and fro across the village, for the
      besieged had not the sense to divide their forces as their enemies had
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril noticed that every now and then certain of the fighting-men would
      enter the maze, and come out with brighter faces, a braver aspect, and a
      more upright carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe they go and touch the Amulet,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You know the Psammead
      said it could make people brave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They crept through the maze, and watching they saw that Cyril was right. A
      headman was standing in front of the skin curtain, and as the warriors
      came before him he murmured a word they could not hear, and touched their
      foreheads with something that they could not see. And this something he
      held in his hands. And through his fingers they saw the gleam of a red
      stone that they knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight raged across the thorn-hedge outside. Suddenly there was a loud
      and bitter cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re in! They&rsquo;re in! The hedge is down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The headman disappeared behind the deer-skin curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone to hide it,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Oh, Psammead dear, how could you
      leave us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a shriek from inside the hut, and the headman staggered
      out white with fear and fled out through the maze. The children were as
      white as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! What is it? What is it?&rsquo; moaned Anthea. &lsquo;Oh, Psammead, how could you!
      How could you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sound of the fight sank breathlessly, and swelled fiercely all
      around. It was like the rising and falling of the waves of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea shuddered and said again, &lsquo;Oh, Psammead, Psammead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said a brisk voice, and the curtain of skins was lifted at one
      corner by a furry hand, and out peeped the bat&rsquo;s ears and snail&rsquo;s eyes of
      the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea caught it in her arms and a sigh of desperate relief was breathed
      by each of the four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! which IS the East!&rsquo; Anthea said, and she spoke hurriedly, for the
      noise of wild fighting drew nearer and nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t choke me,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;come inside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The inside of the hut was pitch dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a match,&rsquo; said Cyril, and struck it. The floor of the hut was of
      soft, loose sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been asleep here,&rsquo; said the Psammead; &lsquo;most comfortable it&rsquo;s been,
      the best sand I&rsquo;ve had for a month. It&rsquo;s all right. Everything&rsquo;s all
      right. I knew your only chance would be while the fight was going on. That
      man won&rsquo;t come back. I bit him, and he thinks I&rsquo;m an Evil Spirit. Now
      you&rsquo;ve only got to take the thing and go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The hut was hung with skins. Heaped in the middle were the offerings that
      had been given the night before, Anthea&rsquo;s roses fading on the top of the
      heap. At one side of the hut stood a large square stone block, and on it
      an oblong box of earthenware with strange figures of men and beasts on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the thing in there?&rsquo; asked Cyril, as the Psammead pointed a skinny
      finger at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must judge of that,&rsquo; said the Psammead. &lsquo;The man was just going to
      bury the box in the sand when I jumped out at him and bit him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Light another match, Robert,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Now, then quick! which is the
      East?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, where the sun rises, of course!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But someone told us&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! they&rsquo;ll tell you anything!&rsquo; said the Psammead impatiently, getting
      into its bass-bag and wrapping itself in its waterproof sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we can&rsquo;t see the sun in here, and it isn&rsquo;t rising anyhow,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How you do waste time!&rsquo; the Psammead said. &lsquo;Why, the East&rsquo;s where the
      shrine is, of course. THERE!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It pointed to the great stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still the shouting and the clash of stone on metal sounded nearer and
      nearer. The children could hear that the headmen had surrounded the hut to
      protect their treasure as long as might be from the enemy. But none dare
      to come in after the Psammead&rsquo;s sudden fierce biting of the headman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Jane,&rsquo; said Cyril, very quickly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take the Amulet, you stand
      ready to hold up the charm, and be sure you don&rsquo;t let it go as you come
      through.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a step forward, but at that instant a great crackling overhead
      ended in a blaze of sunlight. The roof had been broken in at one side, and
      great slabs of it were being lifted off by two spears. As the children
      trembled and winked in the new light, large dark hands tore down the wall,
      and a dark face, with a blobby fat nose, looked over the gap. Even at that
      awful moment Anthea had time to think that it was very like the face of Mr
      Jacob Absalom, who had sold them the charm in the shop near Charing Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is their Amulet,&rsquo; cried a harsh, strange voice; &lsquo;it is this that
      makes them strong to fight and brave to die. And what else have we here&mdash;gods
      or demons?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glared fiercely at the children, and the whites of his eyes were very
      white indeed. He had a wet, red copper knife in his teeth. There was not a
      moment to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane, JANE, QUICK!&rsquo; cried everyone passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane with trembling hands held up the charm towards the East, and Cyril
      spoke the word of power. The Amulet grew to a great arch. Out beyond it
      was the glaring Egyptian sky, the broken wall, the cruel, dark, big-nosed
      face with the red, wet knife in its gleaming teeth. Within the arch was
      the dull, faint, greeny-brown of London grass and trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold tight, Jane!&rsquo; Cyril cried, and he dashed through the arch, dragging
      Anthea and the Psammead after him. Robert followed, clutching Jane. And in
      the ears of each, as they passed through the arch of the charm, the sound
      and fury of battle died out suddenly and utterly, and they heard only the
      low, dull, discontented hum of vast London, and the peeking and patting of
      the sparrows on the gravel and the voices of the ragged baby children
      playing Ring-o&rsquo;-Roses on the yellow trampled grass. And the charm was a
      little charm again in Jane&rsquo;s hand, and there was the basket with their
      dinner and the bathbuns lying just where they had left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My hat!&rsquo; said Cyril, drawing a long breath; &lsquo;that was something like an
      adventure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was rather like one, certainly,&rsquo; said the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all lay still, breathing in the safe, quiet air of Regent&rsquo;s Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;d better go home at once,&rsquo; said Anthea presently. &lsquo;Old Nurse will be
      most frightfully anxious. The sun looks about the same as it did when we
      started yesterday. We&rsquo;ve been away twenty-four hours.&rsquo; &lsquo;The buns are quite
      soft still,&rsquo; said Cyril, feeling one; &lsquo;I suppose the dew kept them fresh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not hungry, curiously enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      They picked up the dinner-basket and the Psammead-basket, and went
      straight home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Nurse met them with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if ever I did!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s gone wrong? You&rsquo;ve soon tired of
      your picnic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children took this to be bitter irony, which means saying the exact
      opposite of what you mean in order to make yourself disagreeable; as when
      you happen to have a dirty face, and someone says, &lsquo;How nice and clean you
      look!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry,&rsquo; began Anthea, but old Nurse said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, bless me, child, I don&rsquo;t care! Please yourselves and you&rsquo;ll please
      me. Come in and get your dinners comf&rsquo;table. I&rsquo;ve got a potato on
      a-boiling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone to attend to the potatoes the children looked at each
      other. Could it be that old Nurse had so changed that she no longer cared
      that they should have been away from home for twenty-four hours&mdash;all
      night in fact&mdash;without any explanation whatever?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Psammead put its head out of its basket and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Don&rsquo;t you understand? You come back through the
      charm-arch at the same time as you go through it. This isn&rsquo;t tomorrow!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Is it still yesterday?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s today. The same as it&rsquo;s always been. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to go mixing
      up the present and the Past, and cutting bits out of one to fit into the
      other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then all that adventure took no time at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can call it that if you like,&rsquo; said the Psammead. &lsquo;It took none of
      the modern time, anyhow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Anthea carried up a steak for the learned gentleman&rsquo;s dinner.
      She persuaded Beatrice, the maid-of-all-work, who had given her the bangle
      with the blue stone, to let her do it. And she stayed and talked to him,
      by special invitation, while he ate the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him the whole adventure, beginning with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This afternoon we found ourselves on the bank of the River Nile,&rsquo; and
      ending up with, &lsquo;And then we remembered how to get back, and there we were
      in Regent&rsquo;s Park, and it hadn&rsquo;t taken any time at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not tell anything about the charm or the Psammead, because that
      was forbidden, but the story was quite wonderful enough even as it was to
      entrance the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a most unusual little girl,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Who tells you all these
      things?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;they just happen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make-believe,&rsquo; he said slowly, as one who recalls and pronounces a
      long-forgotten word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat long after she had left him. At last he roused himself with a
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really must take a holiday,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;my nerves must be all out of
      order. I actually have a perfectly distinct impression that the little
      girl from the rooms below came in and gave me a coherent and graphic
      picture of life as I conceive it to have been in pre-dynastic Egypt.
      Strange what tricks the mind will play! I shall have to be more careful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his bread conscientiously, and actually went for a mile walk
      before he went back to his work.

      CHAPTER 6. THE WAY TO BABYLON
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;How many miles to Babylon?
   Three score and ten!
   Can I get there by candle light?
   Yes, and back again!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Jane was singing to her doll, rocking it to and fro in the house which she
      had made for herself and it. The roof of the house was the dining-table,
      and the walls were tablecloths and antimacassars hanging all round, and
      kept in their places by books laid on their top ends at the table edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others were tasting the fearful joys of domestic tobogganing. You know
      how it is done&mdash;with the largest and best tea-tray and the surface of
      the stair carpet. It is best to do it on the days when the stair rods are
      being cleaned, and the carpet is only held by the nails at the top. Of
      course, it is one of the five or six thoroughly tip-top games that
      grown-up people are so unjust to&mdash;and old Nurse, though a brick in
      many respects, was quite enough of a standard grown-up to put her foot
      down on the tobogganing long before any of the performers had had half
      enough of it. The tea-tray was taken away, and the baffled party entered
      the sitting-room, in exactly the mood not to be pleased if they could help
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Cyril said, &lsquo;What a beastly mess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Robert added, &lsquo;Do shut up, Jane!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Anthea, who was almost always kind, advised Jane to try another song.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sick to death of that,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wet day, so none of the plans for seeing all the sights of London
      that can be seen for nothing could be carried out. Everyone had been
      thinking all the morning about the wonderful adventures of the day before,
      when Jane had held up the charm and it had turned into an arch, through
      which they had walked straight out of the present time and the Regent&rsquo;s
      Park into the land of Egypt eight thousand years ago. The memory of
      yesterday&rsquo;s happenings was still extremely fresh and frightening, so that
      everyone hoped that no one would suggest another excursion into the past,
      for it seemed to all that yesterday&rsquo;s adventures were quite enough to last
      for at least a week. Yet each felt a little anxious that the others should
      not think it was afraid, and presently Cyril, who really was not a coward,
      began to see that it would not be at all nice if he should have to think
      himself one. So he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say&mdash;about that charm&mdash;Jane&mdash;come out. We ought to talk
      about it, anyhow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane obediently wriggled to the front of her house and sat there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt for the charm, to make sure that it was still round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ISN&rsquo;T all,&rsquo; said Cyril, saying much more than he meant because he
      thought Robert&rsquo;s tone had been rude&mdash;as indeed it had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We ought to go and look for that Amulet. What&rsquo;s the good of having a
      first-class charm and keeping it idle, just eating its head off in the
      stable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;M game for anything, of course,&rsquo; said Robert; but he added, with a fine
      air of chivalry, &lsquo;only I don&rsquo;t think the girls are keen today somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes; I am,&rsquo; said Anthea hurriedly. &lsquo;If you think I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;m
      not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am though,&rsquo; said Jane heavily; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it, and I won&rsquo;t go there
      again&mdash;not for anything I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t go THERE again, silly,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;it would be some other
      place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay; a place with lions and tigers in it as likely as not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Jane so frightened, made the others feel quite brave. They said
      they were certain they ought to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so ungrateful to the Psammead not to,&rsquo; Anthea added, a little
      primly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane stood up. She was desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t! If you make me I&rsquo;ll
      scream and I&rsquo;ll scream, and I&rsquo;ll tell old Nurse, and I&rsquo;ll get her to burn
      the charm in the kitchen fire. So now, then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can imagine how furious everyone was with Jane for feeling what each
      of them had felt all the morning. In each breast the same thought arose,
      &lsquo;No one can say it&rsquo;s OUR fault.&rsquo; And they at once began to show Jane how
      angry they all felt that all the fault was hers. This made them feel quite
      brave.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;Tell-tale tit, its tongue shall be split,
   And all the dogs in our town shall have a little bit,&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      sang Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s always the way if you have girls in anything.&rsquo; Cyril spoke in a cold
      displeasure that was worse than Robert&rsquo;s cruel quotation, and even Anthea
      said, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;M not afraid if I AM a girl,&rsquo; which of course, was the most
      cutting thing of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane picked up her doll and faced the others with what is sometimes called
      the courage of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, so there! It&rsquo;s just silly going to
      places when you don&rsquo;t want to, and when you don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re going
      to be like! You can laugh at me as much as you like. You&rsquo;re beasts&mdash;and
      I hate you all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these awful words she went out and banged the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the others would not look at each other, and they did not feel so
      brave as they had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril took up a book, but it was not interesting to read. Robert kicked a
      chair-leg absently. His feet were always eloquent in moments of emotion.
      Anthea stood pleating the end of the tablecloth into folds&mdash;she
      seemed earnestly anxious to get all the pleats the same size. The sound of
      Jane&rsquo;s sobs had died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Anthea said, &lsquo;Oh! let it be &ldquo;pax&rdquo;&mdash;poor little Pussy&mdash;you
      know she&rsquo;s the youngest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She called us beasts,&rsquo; said Robert, kicking the chair suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, said Cyril, who was subject to passing fits of justice, &lsquo;we began,
      you know. At least you did.&rsquo; Cyril&rsquo;s justice was always uncompromising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say I&rsquo;m sorry if you mean that,&rsquo; said Robert, and the
      chair-leg cracked to the kick he gave as he said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, do let&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;we&rsquo;re three to one, and Mother does so hate
      it if we row. Come on. I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m sorry first, though I didn&rsquo;t say
      anything, hardly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, let&rsquo;s get it over,&rsquo; said Cyril, opening the door.&lsquo;Hi&mdash;you&mdash;Pussy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away up the stairs a voice could be heard singing brokenly, but still
      defiantly&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;How many miles (sniff) to Babylon?
   Three score and ten! (sniff)
   Can I get there by candle light?
   Yes (sniff), and back again!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      It was trying, for this was plainly meant to annoy. But Anthea would not
      give herself time to think this. She led the way up the stairs, taking
      three at a time, and bounded to the level of Jane, who sat on the top step
      of all, thumping her doll to the tune of the song she was trying to sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Pussy, let it be pax! We&rsquo;re sorry if you are&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was enough. The kiss of peace was given by all. Jane being the youngest
      was entitled to this ceremonial. Anthea added a special apology of her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I was a pig, Pussy dear,&rsquo; she said&mdash;&lsquo;especially because
      in my really and truly inside mind I&rsquo;ve been feeling a little as if I&rsquo;d
      rather not go into the Past again either. But then, do think. If we don&rsquo;t
      go we shan&rsquo;t get the Amulet, and oh, Pussy, think if we could only get
      Father and Mother and The Lamb safe back! We MUST go, but we&rsquo;ll wait a day
      or two if you like and then perhaps you&rsquo;ll feel braver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Raw meat makes you brave, however cowardly you are,&rsquo; said Robert, to show
      that there was now no ill-feeling, &lsquo;and cranberries&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
      Tartars eat, and they&rsquo;re so brave it&rsquo;s simply awful. I suppose cranberries
      are only for Christmas time, but I&rsquo;ll ask old Nurse to let you have your
      chop very raw if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I could be brave without that,&rsquo; said Jane hastily; she hated
      underdone meat. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door of the learned gentleman&rsquo;s room opened, and he
      looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; he said, in that gentle, polite weary voice of his, &lsquo;but was
      I mistaken in thinking that I caught a familiar word just now? Were you
      not singing some old ballad of Babylon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;at least Jane was singing &ldquo;How many miles,&rdquo; but I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you could have heard the words for&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have said, &lsquo;for the sniffing,&rsquo; but Anthea pinched him just in
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not hear ALL the words,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman. &lsquo;I wonder
      would you recite them to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they all said together&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;How many miles to Babylon?
   Three score and ten!
   Can I get there by candle light?
   Yes, and back again!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish one could,&rsquo; the learned gentleman said with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Babylon has fallen,&rsquo; he answered with a sigh. &lsquo;You know it was once a
      great and beautiful city, and the centre of learning and Art, and now it
      is only ruins, and so covered up with earth that people are not even
      agreed as to where it once stood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning on the banisters, and his eyes had a far-away look in them,
      as though he could see through the staircase window the splendour and
      glory of ancient Babylon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; Cyril remarked abruptly. &lsquo;You know that charm we showed you, and
      you told us how to say the name that&rsquo;s on it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, do you think that charm was ever in Babylon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible,&rsquo; the learned gentleman replied. &lsquo;Such charms have
      been found in very early Egyptian tombs, yet their origin has not been
      accurately determined as Egyptian. They may have been brought from Asia.
      Or, supposing the charm to have been fashioned in Egypt, it might very
      well have been carried to Babylon by some friendly embassy, or brought
      back by the Babylonish army from some Egyptian campaign as part of the
      spoils of war. The inscription may be much later than the charm. Oh yes!
      it is a pleasant fancy, that that splendid specimen of yours was once used
      amid Babylonish surroundings.&rsquo; The others looked at each other, but it was
      Jane who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were the Babylon people savages, were they always fighting and throwing
      things about?&rsquo; For she had read the thoughts of the others by the unerring
      light of her own fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Babylonians were certainly more gentle than the Assyrians,&rsquo; said the
      learned gentleman. &lsquo;And they were not savages by any means. A very high
      level of culture,&rsquo; he looked doubtfully at his audience and went on, &lsquo;I
      mean that they made beautiful statues and jewellery, and built splendid
      palaces. And they were very learned&mdash;they had glorious libraries and
      high towers for the purpose of astrological and astronomical observation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Er?&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean for&mdash;star-gazing and fortune-telling,&rsquo; said the learned
      gentleman, &lsquo;and there were temples and beautiful hanging gardens&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Babylon if you like,&rsquo; said Jane abruptly, and the others
      hastened to say &lsquo;Done!&rsquo; before she should have time to change her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman, smiling rather sadly, &lsquo;one can go so far
      in dreams, when one is young.&rsquo; He sighed again, and then adding with a
      laboured briskness, &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll have a&mdash;a&mdash;jolly game,&rsquo; he
      went into his room and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said &ldquo;jolly&rdquo; as if it was a foreign language,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;Come on,
      let&rsquo;s get the Psammead and go now. I think Babylon seems a most
      frightfully jolly place to go to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they woke the Psammead and put it in its bass-bag with the waterproof
      sheet, in case of inclement weather in Babylon. It was very cross, but it
      said it would as soon go to Babylon as anywhere else. &lsquo;The sand is good
      thereabouts,&rsquo; it added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jane held up the charm, and Cyril said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to go to Babylon to look for the part of you that was lost. Will
      you please let us go there through you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please put us down just outside,&rsquo; said Jane hastily; &lsquo;and then if we
      don&rsquo;t like it we needn&rsquo;t go inside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be all day,&rsquo; said the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Anthea hastily uttered the word of power, without which the charm could
      do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ur&mdash;Hekau&mdash;Setcheh!&rsquo; she said softly, and as she spoke the
      charm grew into an arch so tall that the top of it was close against the
      bedroom ceiling. Outside the arch was the bedroom painted chest-of-drawers
      and the Kidderminster carpet, and the washhand-stand with the riveted
      willow-pattern jug, and the faded curtains, and the dull light of indoors
      on a wet day. Through the arch showed the gleam of soft green leaves and
      white blossoms. They stepped forward quite happily. Even Jane felt that
      this did not look like lions, and her hand hardly trembled at all as she
      held the charm for the others to go through, and last, slipped through
      herself, and hung the charm, now grown small again, round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children found themselves under a white-blossomed, green-leafed
      fruit-tree, in what seemed to be an orchard of such trees, all
      white-flowered and green-foliaged. Among the long green grass under their
      feet grew crocuses and lilies, and strange blue flowers. In the branches
      overhead thrushes and blackbirds were singing, and the coo of a pigeon
      came softly to them in the green quietness of the orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how perfectly lovely!&rsquo; cried Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s like home exactly&mdash;I mean England&mdash;only everything&rsquo;s
      bluer, and whiter, and greener, and the flowers are bigger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys owned that it certainly was fairly decent, and even Jane admitted
      that it was all very pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m certain there&rsquo;s nothing to be frightened of here,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;I suppose the fruit-trees go on just the same
      even when people are killing each other. I didn&rsquo;t half like what the
      learned gentleman said about the hanging gardens. I suppose they have
      gardens on purpose to hang people in. I do hope this isn&rsquo;t one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;The hanging gardens are just gardens
      hung up&mdash;<i>I</i> think on chains between houses, don&rsquo;t you know,
      like trays. Come on; let&rsquo;s get somewhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to walk through the cool grass. As far as they could see was
      nothing but trees, and trees and more trees. At the end of their orchard
      was another one, only separated from theirs by a little stream of clear
      water. They jumped this, and went on. Cyril, who was fond of gardening&mdash;which
      meant that he liked to watch the gardener at work&mdash;was able to
      command the respect of the others by telling them the names of a good many
      trees. There were nut-trees and almond-trees, and apricots, and fig-trees
      with their big five-fingered leaves. And every now and then the children
      had to cross another brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like between the squares in Through the Looking-glass,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they came to an orchard which was quite different from the other
      orchards. It had a low building in one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These are vines,&rsquo; said Cyril superiorly, &lsquo;and I know this is a vineyard.
      I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if there was a wine-press inside that place over
      there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they got out of the orchards and on to a sort of road, very rough,
      and not at all like the roads you are used to. It had cypress trees and
      acacia trees along it, and a sort of hedge of tamarisks, like those you
      see on the road between Nice and Cannes, or near Littlehampton, if you&rsquo;ve
      only been as far as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now in front of them they could see a great mass of buildings. There
      were scattered houses of wood and stone here and there among green
      orchards, and beyond these a great wall that shone red in the early
      morning sun. The wall was enormously high&mdash;more than half the height
      of St Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;and in the wall were set enormous gates that shone like
      gold as the rising sun beat on them. Each gate had a solid square tower on
      each side of it that stood out from the wall and rose above it. Beyond the
      wall were more towers and houses, gleaming with gold and bright colours.
      Away to the left ran the steel-blue swirl of a great river. And the
      children could see, through a gap in the trees, that the river flowed out
      from the town under a great arch in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those feathery things along by the water are palms,&rsquo; said Cyril
      instructively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes; you know everything,&rsquo; Robert replied. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all that
      grey-green stuff you see away over there, where it&rsquo;s all flat and sandy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Cyril loftily, &lsquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to tell you
      anything. I only thought you&rsquo;d like to know a palm-tree when you saw it
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look!&rsquo; cried Anthea; &lsquo;they&rsquo;re opening the gates.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed the great gates swung back with a brazen clang, and instantly a
      little crowd of a dozen or more people came out and along the road towards
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children, with one accord, crouched behind the tamarisk hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the sound of those gates,&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;Fancy being inside
      when they shut. You&rsquo;d never get out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got an arch of your own to go out by,&rsquo; the Psammead put its head
      out of the basket to remind her. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t behave so like a girl. If I were
      you I should just march right into the town and ask to see the king.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something at once simple and grand about this idea, and it
      pleased everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when the work-people had passed (they WERE work-people, the children
      felt sure, because they were dressed so plainly&mdash;just one long blue
      shirt thing&mdash;of blue or yellow) the four children marched boldly up
      to the brazen gate between the towers. The arch above the gate was quite a
      tunnel, the walls were so thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Courage,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;Step out. It&rsquo;s no use trying to sneak past. Be
      bold!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert answered this appeal by unexpectedly bursting into &lsquo;The British
      Grenadiers&rsquo;, and to its quick-step they approached the gates of Babylon.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;Some talk of Alexander,
   And some of Hercules,
   Of Hector and Lysander,
   And such great names as these.
   But of all the gallant heroes...&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      This brought them to the threshold of the gate, and two men in bright
      armour suddenly barred their way with crossed spears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo; they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      (I think I must have explained to you before how it was that the children
      were always able to understand the language of any place they might happen
      to be in, and to be themselves understood. If not, I have no time to
      explain it now.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We come from very far,&rsquo; said Cyril mechanically. &lsquo;From the Empire where
      the sun never sets, and we want to see your King.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s quite convenient,&rsquo; amended Anthea. &lsquo;The King (may he live for
      ever!),&rsquo; said the gatekeeper, &lsquo;is gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife.
      Where on earth have you come from not to know that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Queen then,&rsquo; said Anthea hurriedly, and not taking any notice of the
      question as to where they had come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Queen,&rsquo; said the gatekeeper, &lsquo;(may she live for ever!) gives audience
      today three hours after sunrising.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what are we to do till the end of the three hours?&rsquo; asked Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gatekeeper seemed neither to know nor to care. He appeared less
      interested in them than they could have thought possible. But the man who
      had crossed spears with him to bar the children&rsquo;s way was more human.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let them go in and look about them,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wager my best sword
      they&rsquo;ve never seen anything to come near our little&mdash;village.&rsquo; He
      said it in the tone people use for when they call the Atlantic Ocean the
      &lsquo;herring pond&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gatekeeper hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re only children, after all,&rsquo; said the other, who had children of
      his own. &lsquo;Let me off for a few minutes, Captain, and I&rsquo;ll take them to my
      place and see if my good woman can&rsquo;t fit them up in something a little
      less outlandish than their present rig. Then they can have a look round
      without being mobbed. May I go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, if you like,&rsquo; said the Captain, &lsquo;but don&rsquo;t be all day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man led them through the dark arch into the town. And it was very
      different from London. For one thing, everything in London seems to be
      patched up out of odds and ends, but these houses seemed to have been
      built by people who liked the same sort of things. Not that they were all
      alike, for though all were squarish, they were of different sizes, and
      decorated in all sorts of different ways, some with paintings in bright
      colours, some with black and silver designs. There were terraces, and
      gardens, and balconies, and open spaces with trees. Their guide took them
      to a little house in a back street, where a kind-faced woman sat spinning
      at the door of a very dark room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;just lend these children a mantle each, so that they can
      go about and see the place till the Queen&rsquo;s audience begins. You leave
      that wool for a bit, and show them round if you like. I must be off now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman did as she was told, and the four children, wrapped in fringed
      mantles, went with her all about the town, and oh! how I wish I had time
      to tell you all that they saw. It was all so wonderfully different from
      anything you have ever seen. For one thing, all the houses were dazzlingly
      bright, and many of them covered with pictures. Some had great creatures
      carved in stone at each side of the door. Then the people&mdash;there were
      no black frock-coats and tall hats; no dingy coats and skirts of good,
      useful, ugly stuffs warranted to wear. Everyone&rsquo;s clothes were bright and
      beautiful with blue and scarlet and green and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The market was brighter than you would think anything could be. There were
      stalls for everything you could possibly want&mdash;and for a great many
      things that if you wanted here and now, want would be your master. There
      were pineapples and peaches in heaps&mdash;and stalls of crockery and
      glass things, beautiful shapes and glorious colours, there were stalls for
      necklaces, and clasps, and bracelets, and brooches, for woven stuffs, and
      furs, and embroidered linen. The children had never seen half so many
      beautiful things together, even at Liberty&rsquo;s. It seemed no time at all
      before the woman said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nearly time now. We ought to be getting on towards the palace. It&rsquo;s
      as well to be early.&rsquo; So they went to the palace, and when they got there
      it was more splendid than anything they had seen yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it was glowing with colours, and with gold and silver and black and
      white&mdash;like some magnificent embroidery. Flight after flight of broad
      marble steps led up to it, and at the edges of the stairs stood great
      images, twenty times as big as a man&mdash;images of men with wings like
      chain armour, and hawks&rsquo; heads, and winged men with the heads of dogs. And
      there were the statues of great kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the flights of steps were terraces where fountains played, and the
      Queen&rsquo;s Guard in white and scarlet, and armour that shone like gold, stood
      by twos lining the way up the stairs; and a great body of them was massed
      by the vast door of the palace itself, where it stood glittering like an
      impossibly radiant peacock in the noon-day sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      All sorts of people were passing up the steps to seek audience of the
      Queen. Ladies in richly-embroidered dresses with fringy flounces, poor
      folks in plain and simple clothes, dandies with beards oiled and curled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cyril, Robert, Anthea and Jane, went with the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate of the palace the Psammead put one eye cautiously out of the
      basket and whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered with queens. I&rsquo;ll go home with this lady. I&rsquo;m sure
      she&rsquo;ll get me some sand if you ask her to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t leave us,&rsquo; said Jane. The woman was giving some last
      instructions in Court etiquette to Anthea, and did not hear Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a little muff,&rsquo; said the Psammead quite fiercely. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a
      bit of good your having a charm. You never use it. If you want me you&rsquo;ve
      only got to say the name of power and ask the charm to bring me to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather go with you,&rsquo; said Jane. And it was the most surprising thing
      she had ever said in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone opened its mouth without thinking of manners, and Anthea, who was
      peeping into the Psammead&rsquo;s basket, saw that its mouth opened wider than
      anybody&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t gawp like that,&rsquo; Jane went on. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be bothered
      with queens any more than IT is. And I know, wherever it is, it&rsquo;ll take
      jolly good care that it&rsquo;s safe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s right there,&rsquo; said everyone, for they had observed that the
      Psammead had a way of knowing which side its bread was buttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the woman and said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take me home with you, won&rsquo;t
      you? And let me play with your little girls till the others have done with
      the Queen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely I will, little heart!&rsquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Anthea hurriedly stroked the Psammead and embraced Jane, who took
      the woman&rsquo;s hand, and trotted contentedly away with the Psammead&rsquo;s bag
      under the other arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others stood looking after her till she, the woman, and the basket
      were lost in the many-coloured crowd. Then Anthea turned once more to the
      palace&rsquo;s magnificent doorway and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s ask the porter to take care of our Babylonian overcoats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they took off the garments that the woman had lent them and stood amid
      the jostling petitioners of the Queen in their own English frocks and
      coats and hats and boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to see the Queen,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;we come from the far Empire where
      the sun never sets!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of surprise and a thrill of excitement ran through the crowd. The
      door-porter spoke to a black man, he spoke to someone else. There was a
      whispering, waiting pause. Then a big man, with a cleanly-shaven face,
      beckoned them from the top of a flight of red marble steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up; the boots of Robert clattering more than usual because he
      was so nervous. A door swung open, a curtain was drawn back. A double line
      of bowing forms in gorgeous raiment formed a lane that led to the steps of
      the throne, and as the children advanced hurriedly there came from the
      throne a voice very sweet and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three children from the land where the sun never sets! Let them draw
      hither without fear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute they were kneeling at the throne&rsquo;s foot, saying, &lsquo;O
      Queen, live for ever!&rsquo; exactly as the woman had taught them. And a
      splendid dream-lady, all gold and silver and jewels and snowy drift of
      veils, was raising Anthea, and saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, I really am SO glad you came! The land where the sun
      never sets! I am delighted to see you! I was getting quite too dreadfully
      bored for anything!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And behind Anthea the kneeling Cyril whispered in the ears of the
      respectful Robert&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bobs, don&rsquo;t say anything to Panther. It&rsquo;s no use upsetting her, but we
      didn&rsquo;t ask for Jane&rsquo;s address, and the Psammead&rsquo;s with her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; whispered Robert, &lsquo;the charm can bring them to us at any moment.
      IT said so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; whispered Cyril, in miserable derision, &lsquo;WE&rsquo;RE all right, of
      course. So we are! Oh, yes! If we&rsquo;d only GOT the charm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Robert saw, and he murmured, &lsquo;Crikey!&rsquo; at the foot of the throne of
      Babylon; while Cyril hoarsely whispered the plain English fact&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane&rsquo;s got the charm round her neck, you silly cuckoo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Crikey!&rsquo; Robert repeated in heart-broken undertones.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7. &lsquo;THE DEEPEST DUNGEON BELOW THE CASTLE MOAT&rsquo; 
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Queen threw three of the red and gold embroidered cushions off the
      throne on to the marble steps that led up to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just make yourselves comfortable there,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m simply dying to
      talk to you, and to hear all about your wonderful country and how you got
      here, and everything, but I have to do justice every morning. Such a bore,
      isn&rsquo;t it? Do you do justice in your own country?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, said Cyril; &lsquo;at least of course we try to, but not in this public
      sort of way, only in private.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, yes,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;I should much
      prefer a private audience myself&mdash;much easier to manage. But public
      opinion has to be considered. Doing justice is very hard work, even when
      you&rsquo;re brought up to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t do justice, but we have to do scales, Jane and me,&rsquo; said Anthea,
      &lsquo;twenty minutes a day. It&rsquo;s simply horrid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are scales?&rsquo; asked the Queen, &lsquo;and what is Jane?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane is my little sister. One of the guards-at-the-gate&rsquo;s wife is taking
      care of her. And scales are music.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard of the instrument,&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;Do you sing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes. We can sing in parts,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That IS magic,&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;How many parts are you each cut into
      before you do it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We aren&rsquo;t cut at all,&rsquo; said Robert hastily. &lsquo;We couldn&rsquo;t sing if we were.
      We&rsquo;ll show you afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you shall, and now sit quiet like dear children and hear me do
      justice. The way I do it has always been admired. I oughtn&rsquo;t to say that
      ought I? Sounds so conceited. But I don&rsquo;t mind with you, dears. Somehow I
      feel as though I&rsquo;d known you quite a long time already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen settled herself on her throne and made a signal to her
      attendants. The children, whispering together among the cushions on the
      steps of the throne, decided that she was very beautiful and very kind,
      but perhaps just the least bit flighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person who came to ask for justice was a woman whose brother had
      taken the money the father had left for her. The brother said it was the
      uncle who had the money. There was a good deal of talk and the children
      were growing rather bored, when the Queen suddenly clapped her hands, and
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put both the men in prison till one of them owns up that the other is
      innocent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose they both did it?&rsquo; Cyril could not help interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then prison&rsquo;s the best place for them,&rsquo; said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose neither did it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rsquo; said the Queen; &lsquo;a thing&rsquo;s not done unless someone
      does it. And you mustn&rsquo;t interrupt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a woman, in tears, with a torn veil and real ashes on her head&mdash;at
      least Anthea thought so, but it may have been only road-dust. She
      complained that her husband was in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They SAID it was for speaking evil of your Majesty,&rsquo; said the woman, &lsquo;but
      it wasn&rsquo;t. Someone had a spite against him. That was what it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know he hadn&rsquo;t spoken evil of me?&rsquo; said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one could,&rsquo; said the woman simply, &lsquo;when they&rsquo;d once seen your
      beautiful face.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the man out,&rsquo; said the Queen, smiling. &lsquo;Next case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next case was that of a boy who had stolen a fox. &lsquo;Like the Spartan
      boy,&rsquo; whispered Robert. But the Queen ruled that nobody could have any
      possible reason for owning a fox, and still less for stealing one. And she
      did not believe that there were any foxes in Babylon; she, at any rate,
      had never seen one. So the boy was released.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people came to the Queen about all sorts of family quarrels and
      neighbourly misunderstandings&mdash;from a fight between brothers over the
      division of an inheritance, to the dishonest and unfriendly conduct of a
      woman who had borrowed a cooking-pot at the last New Year&rsquo;s festival, and
      not returned it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Queen decided everything, very, very decidedly indeed. At last she
      clapped her hands quite suddenly and with extreme loudness, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The audience is over for today.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone said, &lsquo;May the Queen live for ever!&rsquo; and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the children were left alone in the justice-hall with the Queen of
      Babylon and her ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said the Queen, with a long sigh of relief. &lsquo;THAT&rsquo;S over! I
      couldn&rsquo;t have done another stitch of justice if you&rsquo;d offered me the crown
      of Egypt! Now come into the garden, and we&rsquo;ll have a nice, long, cosy
      talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She led them through long, narrow corridors whose walls they somehow felt,
      were very, very thick, into a sort of garden courtyard. There were thick
      shrubs closely planted, and roses were trained over trellises, and made a
      pleasant shade&mdash;needed, indeed, for already the sun was as hot as it
      is in England in August at the seaside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slaves spread cushions on a low, marble terrace, and a big man with a
      smooth face served cool drink in cups of gold studded with beryls. He
      drank a little from the Queen&rsquo;s cup before handing it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s rather a nasty trick,&rsquo; whispered Robert, who had been carefully
      taught never to drink out of one of the nice, shiny, metal cups that are
      chained to the London drinking fountains without first rinsing it out
      thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen overheard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;Ritti-Marduk is a very clean man. And one has to
      have SOME ONE as taster, you know, because of poison.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The word made the children feel rather creepy; but Ritti-Marduk had tasted
      all the cups, so they felt pretty safe. The drink was delicious&mdash;very
      cold, and tasting like lemonade and partly like penny ices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave us,&rsquo; said the Queen. And all the Court ladies, in their beautiful,
      many-folded, many-coloured, fringed dresses, filed out slowly, and the
      children were left alone with the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;tell me all about yourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, Bobs,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;Anthea,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;you&mdash;Cyril,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember how pleased
      the Queen of India was when you told her all about us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril muttered that it was all very well, and so it was. For when he had
      told the tale of the Phoenix and the Carpet to the Ranee, it had been only
      the truth&mdash;and all the truth that he had to tell. But now it was not
      easy to tell a convincing story without mentioning the Amulet&mdash;which,
      of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t have done to mention&mdash;and without owning that
      they were really living in London, about 2,500 years later than the time
      they were talking in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril took refuge in the tale of the Psammead and its wonderful power of
      making wishes come true. The children had never been able to tell anyone
      before, and Cyril was surprised to find that the spell which kept them
      silent in London did not work here. &lsquo;Something to do with our being in the
      Past, I suppose,&rsquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is MOST interesting,&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;We must have this Psammead
      for the banquet tonight. Its performance will be one of the most popular
      turns in the whole programme. Where is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea explained that they did not know; also why it was that they did not
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, THAT&rsquo;S quite simple,&rsquo; said the Queen, and everyone breathed a deep
      sigh of relief as she said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ritti-Marduk shall run down to the gates and find out which guard your
      sister went home with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Might he&rsquo;&mdash;Anthea&rsquo;s voice was tremulous&mdash;&lsquo;might he&mdash;would
      it interfere with his meal-times, or anything like that, if he went NOW?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course he shall go now. He may think himself lucky if he gets his
      meals at any time,&rsquo; said the Queen heartily, and clapped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I send a letter?&rsquo; asked Cyril, pulling out a red-backed penny
      account-book, and feeling in his pockets for a stump of pencil that he
      knew was in one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means. I&rsquo;ll call my scribe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I can scribe right enough, thanks,&rsquo; said Cyril, finding the pencil
      and licking its point. He even had to bite the wood a little, for it was
      very blunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you clever, clever boy!&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;DO let me watch you do it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril wrote on a leaf of the book&mdash;it was of rough, woolly paper,
      with hairs that stuck out and would have got in his pen if he had been
      using one, and ruled for accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hide IT most carefully before you come here,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t
      mention it&mdash;and destroy this letter. Everything is going A1. The
      Queen is a fair treat. There&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What curious characters, and what a strange flat surface!&rsquo; said the
      Queen. &lsquo;What have you inscribed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;scribed,&rsquo; replied Cyril cautiously, &lsquo;that you are fair, and a&mdash;and
      like a&mdash;like a festival; and that she need not be afraid, and that
      she is to come at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ritti-Marduk, who had come in and had stood waiting while Cyril wrote, his
      Babylonish eyes nearly starting out of his Babylonish head, now took the
      letter, with some reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Queen, live for ever! Is it a charm?&rsquo; he timidly asked. &lsquo;A strong
      charm, most great lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YES,&rsquo; said Robert, unexpectedly, &lsquo;it IS a charm, but it won&rsquo;t hurt anyone
      until you&rsquo;ve given it to Jane. And then she&rsquo;ll destroy it, so that it
      CAN&rsquo;T hurt anyone. It&rsquo;s most awful strong!&mdash;as strong as&mdash;Peppermint!&rsquo; 
      he ended abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know not the god,&rsquo; said Ritti-Marduk, bending timorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll tear it up directly she gets it,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll end the
      charm. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid if you go now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ritti-Marduk went, seeming only partly satisfied; and then the Queen began
      to admire the penny account-book and the bit of pencil in so marked and
      significant a way that Cyril felt he could not do less than press them
      upon her as a gift. She ruffled the leaves delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a wonderful substance!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;And with this style you make
      charms? Make a charm for me! Do you know,&rsquo; her voice sank to a whisper,
      &lsquo;the names of the great ones of your own far country?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather!&rsquo; said Cyril, and hastily wrote the names of Alfred the Great,
      Shakespeare, Nelson, Gordon, Lord Beaconsfield, Mr Rudyard Kipling, and Mr
      Sherlock Holmes, while the Queen watched him with &lsquo;unbaited breath&rsquo;, as
      Anthea said afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the book and hid it reverently among the bright folds of her
      gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall teach me later to say the great names,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;And the
      names of their Ministers&mdash;perhaps the great Nisroch is one of them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;Mr Campbell Bannerman&rsquo;s Prime Minister
      and Mr Burns a Minister, and so is the Archbishop of Canterbury, I think,
      but I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;and Dr Parker was one, I know, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more,&rsquo; said the Queen, putting her hands to her ears. &lsquo;My head&rsquo;s going
      round with all those great names. You shall teach them to me later&mdash;because
      of course you&rsquo;ll make us a nice long visit now you have come, won&rsquo;t you?
      Now tell me&mdash;but no, I am quite tired out with your being so clever.
      Besides, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d like ME to tell YOU something, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;I want to know how it is that the King has gone&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me, but you should say &ldquo;the King may-he-live-for-ever&rdquo;,&rsquo; said the
      Queen gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; Anthea hastened to say&mdash;&lsquo;the King
      may-he-live-for-ever has gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife? I don&rsquo;t
      think even Bluebeard had as many as that. And, besides, he hasn&rsquo;t killed
      YOU at any rate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen looked bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She means,&rsquo; explained Robert, &lsquo;that English kings only have one wife&mdash;at
      least, Henry the Eighth had seven or eight, but not all at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In our country,&rsquo; said the Queen scornfully, &lsquo;a king would not reign a day
      who had only one wife. No one would respect him, and quite right too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then are all the other thirteen alive?&rsquo; asked Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course they are&mdash;poor mean-spirited things! I don&rsquo;t associate
      with them, of course, I am the Queen: they&rsquo;re only the wives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Anthea, gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But oh, my dears,&rsquo; the Queen went on, &lsquo;such a to-do as there&rsquo;s been about
      this last wife! You never did! It really was TOO funny. We wanted an
      Egyptian princess. The King may-he-live-for-ever has got a wife from most
      of the important nations, and he had set his heart on an Egyptian one to
      complete his collection. Well, of course, to begin with, we sent a
      handsome present of gold. The Egyptian king sent back some horses&mdash;quite
      a few; he&rsquo;s fearfully stingy!&mdash;and he said he liked the gold very
      much, but what they were really short of was lapis lazuli, so of course we
      sent him some. But by that time he&rsquo;d begun to use the gold to cover the
      beams of the roof of the Temple of the Sun-God, and he hadn&rsquo;t nearly
      enough to finish the job, so we sent some more. And so it went on, oh, for
      years. You see each journey takes at least six months. And at last we
      asked the hand of his daughter in marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and then?&rsquo; said Anthea, who wanted to get to the princess part of
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;when he&rsquo;d got everything out of us that he
      could, and only given the meanest presents in return, he sent to say he
      would esteem the honour of an alliance very highly, only unfortunately he
      hadn&rsquo;t any daughter, but he hoped one would be born soon, and if so, she
      should certainly be reserved for the King of Babylon!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a trick!&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, wasn&rsquo;t it? So then we said his sister would do, and then there were
      more gifts and more journeys; and now at last the tiresome, black-haired
      thing is coming, and the King may-he-live-for-ever has gone seven days&rsquo; 
      journey to meet her at Carchemish. And he&rsquo;s gone in his best chariot, the
      one inlaid with lapis lazuli and gold, with the gold-plated wheels and
      onyx-studded hubs&mdash;much too great an honour in my opinion. She&rsquo;ll be
      here tonight; there&rsquo;ll be a grand banquet to celebrate her arrival. SHE
      won&rsquo;t be present, of course. She&rsquo;ll be having her baths and her
      anointings, and all that sort of thing. We always clean our foreign brides
      very carefully. It takes two or three weeks. Now it&rsquo;s dinnertime, and you
      shall eat with me, for I can see that you are of high rank.&rsquo; She led them
      into a dark, cool hall, with many cushions on the floor. On these they sat
      and low tables were brought&mdash;beautiful tables of smooth, blue stone
      mounted in gold. On these, golden trays were placed; but there were no
      knives, or forks, or spoons. The children expected the Queen to call for
      them; but no. She just ate with her fingers, and as the first dish was a
      great tray of boiled corn, and meat and raisins all mixed up together, and
      melted fat poured all over the tray, it was found difficult to follow her
      example with anything like what we are used to think of as good table
      manners. There were stewed quinces afterwards, and dates in syrup, and
      thick yellowy cream. It was the kind of dinner you hardly ever get in
      Fitzroy Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner everybody went to sleep, even the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen awoke with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;what a time we&rsquo;ve slept! I must rush off and
      dress for the banquet. I shan&rsquo;t have much more than time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Ritti-Marduk got back with our sister and the Psammead yet?&rsquo; 
      Anthea asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I QUITE forgot to ask. I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;And of course they
      wouldn&rsquo;t announce her unless I told them to, except during justice hours.
      I expect she&rsquo;s waiting outside. I&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ritti-Marduk came in a moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I regret,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that I have been unable to find your sister. The
      beast she bears with her in a basket has bitten the child of the guard,
      and your sister and the beast set out to come to you. The police say they
      have a clue. No doubt we shall have news of her in a few weeks.&rsquo; He bowed
      and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horror of this threefold loss&mdash;Jane, the Psammead, and the Amulet&mdash;gave
      the children something to talk about while the Queen was dressing. I shall
      not report their conversation; it was very gloomy. Everyone repeated
      himself several times, and the discussion ended in each of them blaming
      the other two for having let Jane go. You know the sort of talk it was,
      don&rsquo;t you? At last Cyril said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all, she&rsquo;s with the Psammead, so SHE&rsquo;S all right. The Psammead is
      jolly careful of itself too. And it isn&rsquo;t as if we were in any danger.
      Let&rsquo;s try to buck up and enjoy the banquet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They did enjoy the banquet. They had a beautiful bath, which was
      delicious, were heavily oiled all over, including their hair, and that was
      most unpleasant. Then, they dressed again and were presented to the King,
      who was most affable. The banquet was long; there were all sorts of nice
      things to eat, and everybody seemed to eat and drink a good deal. Everyone
      lay on cushions and couches, ladies on one side and gentlemen on the
      other; and after the eating was done each lady went and sat by some
      gentleman, who seemed to be her sweetheart or her husband, for they were
      very affectionate to each other. The Court dresses had gold threads woven
      in them, very bright and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle of the room was left clear, and different people came and did
      amusing things. There were conjurers and jugglers and snake-charmers,
      which last Anthea did not like at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it got dark torches were lighted. Cedar splinters dipped in oil
      blazed in copper dishes set high on poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a dancer, who hardly danced at all, only just struck
      attitudes. She had hardly any clothes, and was not at all pretty. The
      children were rather bored by her, but everyone else was delighted,
      including the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the beard of Nimrod!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;ask what you like girl, and you shall
      have it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want nothing,&rsquo; said the dancer; &lsquo;the honour of having pleased the King
      may-he-live-for-ever is reward enough for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the King was so pleased with this modest and sensible reply that he
      gave her the gold collar off his own neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say!&rsquo; said Cyril, awed by the magnificence of the gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; whispered the Queen, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not his best collar by any
      means. We always keep a stock of cheap jewellery for these occasions. And
      now&mdash;you promised to sing us something. Would you like my minstrels
      to accompany you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; said Anthea quickly. The minstrels had been playing off
      and on all the time, and their music reminded Anthea of the band she and
      the others had once had on the fifth of November&mdash;with penny horns, a
      tin whistle, a tea-tray, the tongs, a policeman&rsquo;s rattle, and a toy drum.
      They had enjoyed this band very much at the time. But it was quite
      different when someone else was making the same kind of music. Anthea
      understood now that Father had not been really heartless and unreasonable
      when he had told them to stop that infuriating din.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall we sing?&rsquo; Cyril was asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sweet and low?&rsquo; suggested Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too soft&mdash;I vote for &ldquo;Who will o&rsquo;er the downs&rdquo;. Now then&mdash;one,
      two, three.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;Oh, who will o&rsquo;er the downs so free,
   Oh, who will with me ride,
   Oh, who will up and follow me,
   To win a blooming bride?

   Her father he has locked the door,
   Her mother keeps the key;
   But neither bolt nor bar shall keep
   My own true love from me.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Jane, the alto, was missing, and Robert, unlike the mother of the lady in
      the song, never could &lsquo;keep the key&rsquo;, but the song, even so, was
      sufficiently unlike anything any of them had ever heard to rouse the
      Babylonian Court to the wildest enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More, more,&rsquo; cried the King; &lsquo;by my beard, this savage music is a new
      thing. Sing again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;I saw her bower at twilight gray,
   &lsquo;Twas guarded safe and sure.
   I saw her bower at break of day,
   &lsquo;Twas guarded then no more.

   The varlets they were all asleep,
   And there was none to see
   The greeting fair that passed there
   Between my love and me.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Shouts of applause greeted the ending of the verse, and the King would not
      be satisfied till they had sung all their part-songs (they only knew
      three) twice over, and ended up with &lsquo;Men of Harlech&rsquo; in unison. Then the
      King stood up in his royal robes with his high, narrow crown on his head
      and shouted&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the beak of Nisroch, ask what you will, strangers from the land where
      the sun never sets!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We ought to say it&rsquo;s enough honour, like the dancer did,&rsquo; whispered
      Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, let&rsquo;s ask for IT,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m sure the other&rsquo;s manners,&rsquo; said Anthea. But Robert, who was
      excited by the music, and the flaring torches, and the applause and the
      opportunity, spoke up before the others could stop him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give us the half of the Amulet that has on it the name UR HEKAU SETCHEH,&rsquo; 
      he said, adding as an afterthought, &lsquo;O King, live-for-ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the great name those in the pillared hall fell on their faces,
      and lay still. All but the Queen who crouched amid her cushions with her
      head in her hands, and the King, who stood upright, perfectly still, like
      the statue of a king in stone. It was only for a moment though. Then his
      great voice thundered out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Guard, seize them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, from nowhere as it seemed, sprang eight soldiers in bright
      armour inlaid with gold, and tunics of red and white. Very splendid they
      were, and very alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impious and sacrilegious wretches!&rsquo; shouted the King. &lsquo;To the dungeons
      with them! We will find a way, tomorrow, to make them speak. For without
      doubt they can tell us where to find the lost half of It.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A wall of scarlet and white and steel and gold closed up round the
      children and hurried them away among the many pillars of the great hall.
      As they went they heard the voices of the courtiers loud in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve done it this time,&rsquo; said Cyril with extreme bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it will come right. It MUST. It always does,&rsquo; said Anthea
      desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not see where they were going, because the guard surrounded
      them so closely, but the ground under their feet, smooth marble at first,
      grew rougher like stone, then it was loose earth and sand, and they felt
      the night air. Then there was more stone, and steps down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my belief we really ARE going to the deepest dungeon below the
      castle moat this time,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they were. At least it was not below a moat, but below the river
      Euphrates, which was just as bad if not worse. In a most unpleasant place
      it was. Dark, very, very damp, and with an odd, musty smell rather like
      the shells of oysters. There was a torch&mdash;that is to say, a copper
      basket on a high stick with oiled wood burning in it. By its light the
      children saw that the walls were green, and that trickles of water ran
      down them and dripped from the roof. There were things on the floor that
      looked like newts, and in the dark corners creepy, shiny things moved
      sluggishly, uneasily, horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert&rsquo;s heart sank right into those really reliable boots of his. Anthea
      and Cyril each had a private struggle with that inside disagreeableness
      which is part of all of us, and which is sometimes called the Old Adam&mdash;and
      both were victors. Neither of them said to Robert (and both tried hard not
      even to think it), &lsquo;This is YOUR doing.&rsquo; Anthea had the additional
      temptation to add, &lsquo;I told you so.&rsquo; And she resisted it successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sacrilege, and impious cheek,&rsquo; said the captain of the guard to the
      gaoler. &lsquo;To be kept during the King&rsquo;s pleasure. I expect he means to get
      some pleasure out of them tomorrow! He&rsquo;ll tickle them up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor little kids,&rsquo; said the gaoler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said the captain. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got kids of my own too. But it doesn&rsquo;t
      do to let domestic sentiment interfere with one&rsquo;s public duties. Good
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers tramped heavily off in their white and red and steel and
      gold. The gaoler, with a bunch of big keys in his hand, stood looking
      pityingly at the children. He shook his head twice and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Courage!&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;I know it will be all right. It&rsquo;s only a dream
      REALLY, you know. It MUST be! I don&rsquo;t believe about time being only a
      something or other of thought. It IS a dream, and we&rsquo;re bound to wake up
      all right and safe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph,&rsquo; said Cyril bitterly. And Robert suddenly said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all my doing. If it really IS all up do please not keep a down on me
      about it, and tell Father&mdash;Oh, I forgot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had forgotten was that his father was 3,000 miles and 5,000 or
      more years away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, Bobs, old man,&rsquo; said Cyril; and Anthea got hold of Robert&rsquo;s
      hand and squeezed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the gaoler came back with a platter of hard, flat cakes made of
      coarse grain, very different from the cream-and-juicy-date feasts of the
      palace; also a pitcher of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, thank you so very much. You ARE kind,&rsquo; said Anthea feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to sleep,&rsquo; said the gaoler, pointing to a heap of straw in a corner;
      &lsquo;tomorrow comes soon enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear Mr Gaoler,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;whatever will they do to us tomorrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll try to make you tell things,&rsquo; said the gaoler grimly, &lsquo;and my
      advice is if you&rsquo;ve nothing to tell, make up something. Then perhaps
      they&rsquo;ll sell you to the Northern nations. Regular savages THEY are. Good
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; said three trembling voices, which their owners strove in
      vain to render firm. Then he went out, and the three were left alone in
      the damp, dim vault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the light won&rsquo;t last long,&rsquo; said Cyril, looking at the flickering
      brazier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it any good, do you think, calling on the name when we haven&rsquo;t got the
      charm?&rsquo; suggested Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think so. But we might try.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they tried. But the blank silence of the damp dungeon remained
      unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was the name the Queen said?&rsquo; asked Cyril suddenly. &lsquo;Nisbeth&mdash;Nesbit&mdash;something?
      You know, the slave of the great names?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a sec,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;though I don&rsquo;t know why you want it. Nusroch&mdash;Nisrock&mdash;Nisroch&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Anthea pulled herself together. All her muscles tightened, and the
      muscles of her mind and soul, if you can call them that, tightened too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;UR HEKAU SETCHEH,&rsquo; she cried in a fervent voice. &lsquo;Oh, Nisroch, servant of
      the Great Ones, come and help us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a waiting silence. Then a cold, blue light awoke in the corner
      where the straw was&mdash;and in the light they saw coming towards them a
      strange and terrible figure. I won&rsquo;t try to describe it, because the
      drawing shows it, exactly as it was, and exactly as the old Babylonians
      carved it on their stones, so that you can see it in our own British
      Museum at this day. I will just say that it had eagle&rsquo;s wings and an
      eagle&rsquo;s head and the body of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came towards them, strong and unspeakably horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, go away,&rsquo; cried Anthea; but Cyril cried, &lsquo;No; stay!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature hesitated, then bowed low before them on the damp floor of
      the dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak,&rsquo; it said, in a harsh, grating voice like large rusty keys being
      turned in locks. &lsquo;The servant of the Great Ones is YOUR servant. What is
      your need that you call on the name of Nisroch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to go home,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; cried Anthea; &lsquo;we want to be where Jane is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nisroch raised his great arm and pointed at the wall of the dungeon. And,
      as he pointed, the wall disappeared, and instead of the damp, green, rocky
      surface, there shone and glowed a room with rich hangings of red silk
      embroidered with golden water-lilies, with cushioned couches and great
      mirrors of polished steel; and in it was the Queen, and before her, on a
      red pillow, sat the Psammead, its fur hunched up in an irritated,
      discontented way. On a blue-covered couch lay Jane fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walk forward without fear,&rsquo; said Nisroch. &lsquo;Is there aught else that the
      Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak that name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;oh, no,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right now. Thanks ever so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a dear,&rsquo; cried Anthea, not in the least knowing what she was
      saying. &lsquo;Oh, thank you thank you. But DO go NOW!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught the hand of the creature, and it was cold and hard in hers,
      like a hand of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go forward,&rsquo; said Nisroch. And they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my good gracious,&rsquo; said the Queen as they stood before her. &lsquo;How did
      you get here? I KNEW you were magic. I meant to let you out the first
      thing in the morning, if I could slip away&mdash;but thanks be to Dagon,
      you&rsquo;ve managed it for yourselves. You must get away. I&rsquo;ll wake my chief
      lady and she shall call Ritti-Marduk, and he&rsquo;ll let you out the back way,
      and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t rouse anybody for goodness&rsquo; sake,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;except Jane, and
      I&rsquo;ll rouse her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook Jane with energy, and Jane slowly awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ritti-Marduk brought them in hours ago, really,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;but I
      wanted to have the Psammead all to myself for a bit. You&rsquo;ll excuse the
      little natural deception?&mdash;it&rsquo;s part of the Babylonish character,
      don&rsquo;t you know? But I don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to you. Do let me
      rouse someone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, no,&rsquo; said Anthea with desperate earnestness. She thought she knew
      enough of what the Babylonians were like when they were roused. &lsquo;We can go
      by our own magic. And you will tell the King it wasn&rsquo;t the gaoler&rsquo;s fault.
      It was Nisroch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nisroch!&rsquo; echoed the Queen. &lsquo;You are indeed magicians.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane sat up, blinking stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold It up, and say the word,&rsquo; cried Cyril, catching up the Psammead,
      which mechanically bit him, but only very slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is the East?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Behind me,&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ur Hekau Setcheh,&rsquo; said Jane sleepily, and held up the charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there they all were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane,&rsquo; cried Cyril with great presence of mind, &lsquo;go and get the plate of
      sand down for the Psammead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; he said quickly, as the sound of her boots grew less loud on
      the stairs, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s tell her about the dungeon and all that. It&rsquo;ll
      only frighten her so that she&rsquo;ll never want to go anywhere else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Righto!&rsquo; said Cyril; but Anthea felt that she could not have said a word
      to save her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you want to come back in such a hurry?&rsquo; asked Jane, returning
      with the plate of sand. &lsquo;It was awfully jolly in Babylon, I think! I liked
      it no end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said Cyril carelessly. &lsquo;It was jolly enough, of course, but I
      thought we&rsquo;d been there long enough. Mother always says you oughtn&rsquo;t to
      wear out your welcome!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 8. THE QUEEN IN LONDON
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now tell us what happened to you,&rsquo; said Cyril to Jane, when he and the
      others had told her all about the Queen&rsquo;s talk and the banquet, and the
      variety entertainment, carefully stopping short before the beginning of
      the dungeon part of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t much good going,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;if you didn&rsquo;t even try to get the
      Amulet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We found out it was no go,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not to be got in Babylon.
      It was lost before that. We&rsquo;ll go to some other jolly friendly place,
      where everyone is kind and pleasant, and look for it there. Now tell us
      about your part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;the Queen&rsquo;s man with the smooth face&mdash;what was his
      name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ritti-Marduk,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;Ritti-Marduk, he came for me just after the Psammead
      had bitten the guard-of-the-gate&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s little boy, and he took me to
      the Palace. And we had supper with the new little Queen from Egypt. She is
      a dear&mdash;not much older than you. She told me heaps about Egypt. And
      we played ball after supper. And then the Babylon Queen sent for me. I
      like her too. And she talked to the Psammead and I went to sleep. And then
      you woke me up. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead, roused from its sound sleep, told the same story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; it added, &lsquo;what possessed you to tell that Queen that I could give
      wishes? I sometimes think you were born without even the most rudimentary
      imitation of brains.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children did not know the meaning of rudimentary, but it sounded a
      rude, insulting word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we did any harm,&rsquo; said Cyril sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said the Psammead with withering irony, &lsquo;not at all! Of course
      not! Quite the contrary! Exactly so! Only she happened to wish that she
      might soon find herself in your country. And soon may mean any moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s your fault,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;because you might just as well have
      made &ldquo;soon&rdquo; mean some moment next year or next century.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s where you, as so often happens, make the mistake,&rsquo; rejoined the
      Sand-fairy. &lsquo;<i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t mean anything but what SHE meant by &ldquo;soon&rdquo;.
      It wasn&rsquo;t my wish. And what SHE meant was the next time the King happens
      to go out lion hunting. So she&rsquo;ll have a whole day, and perhaps two, to do
      as she wishes with. SHE doesn&rsquo;t know about time only being a mode of
      thought.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Cyril, with a sigh of resignation, &lsquo;we must do what we can to
      give her a good time. She was jolly decent to us. I say, suppose we were
      to go to St James&rsquo;s Park after dinner and feed those ducks that we never
      did feed. After all that Babylon and all those years ago, I feel as if I
      should like to see something REAL, and NOW. You&rsquo;ll come, Psammead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s my priceless woven basket of sacred rushes?&rsquo; asked the Psammead
      morosely. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go out with nothing on. And I won&rsquo;t, what&rsquo;s more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then everybody remembered with pain that the bass bag had, in the
      hurry of departure from Babylon, not been remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s not so extra precious,&rsquo; said Robert hastily. &lsquo;You can get them
      given to you for nothing if you buy fish in Farringdon Market.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the Psammead very crossly indeed, &lsquo;so you presume on my sublime
      indifference to the things of this disgusting modern world, to fob me off
      with a travelling equipage that costs you nothing. Very well, I shall go
      to sand. Please don&rsquo;t wake me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And it went then and there to sand, which, as you know, meant to bed. The
      boys went to St James&rsquo;s Park to feed the ducks, but they went alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea and Jane sat sewing all the afternoon. They cut off half a yard
      from each of their best green Liberty sashes. A towel cut in two formed a
      lining; and they sat and sewed and sewed and sewed. What they were making
      was a bag for the Psammead. Each worked at a half of the bag. jane&rsquo;s half
      had four-leaved shamrocks embroidered on it. They were the only things she
      could do (because she had been taught how at school, and, fortunately,
      some of the silk she had been taught with was left over). And even so,
      Anthea had to draw the pattern for her. Anthea&rsquo;s side of the bag had
      letters on it&mdash;worked hastily but affectionately in chain stitch.
      They were something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      PSAMS TRAVEL CAR
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have put &lsquo;travelling carriage&rsquo;, but she made the letters too
      big, so there was no room. The bag was made INTO a bag with old Nurse&rsquo;s
      sewing machine, and the strings of it were Anthea&rsquo;s and Jane&rsquo;s best red
      hair ribbons. At tea-time, when the boys had come home with a most
      unfavourable report of the St james&rsquo;s Park ducks, Anthea ventured to
      awaken the Psammead, and to show it its new travelling bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph,&rsquo; it said, sniffing a little contemptuously, yet at the same time
      affectionately, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not so dusty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that people
      said nowadays. For a creature that had in its time associated with
      Megatheriums and Pterodactyls, its quickness was really wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more worthy of me,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;than the kind of bag that&rsquo;s given away
      with a pound of plaice. When do you propose to take me out in it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere,&rsquo; said Cyril. But
      Jane said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to go to Egypt. I did like that Egyptian Princess that came to
      marry the King in Babylon. She told me about the larks they have in Egypt.
      And the cats. Do let&rsquo;s go there. And I told her what the bird things on
      the Amulet were like. And she said it was Egyptian writing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their
      cleverness in having concealed from Jane the terrors they had suffered in
      the dungeon below the Euphrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Egypt&rsquo;s so nice too,&rsquo; Jane went on, &lsquo;because of Doctor Brewer&rsquo;s Scripture
      History. I would like to go there when Joseph was dreaming those curious
      dreams, or when Moses was doing wonderful things with snakes and sticks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care about snakes,&rsquo; said Anthea shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we needn&rsquo;t be in at that part, but Babylon was lovely! We had cream
      and sweet, sticky stuff. And I expect Egypt&rsquo;s the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of discussion, but it all ended in everybody&rsquo;s
      agreeing to Jane&rsquo;s idea. And next morning directly after breakfast (which
      was kippers and very nice) the Psammead was invited to get into his
      travelling carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment after it had done so, with stiff, furry reluctance, like that
      of a cat when you want to nurse it, and its ideas are not the same as
      yours, old Nurse came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, chickies,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;are you feeling very dull?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, Nurse dear,&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re having a lovely time. We&rsquo;re just
      going off to see some old ancient relics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said old Nurse, &lsquo;the Royal Academy, I suppose? Don&rsquo;t go wasting your
      money too reckless, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She cleared away the kipper bones and the tea-things, and when she had
      swept up the crumbs and removed the cloth, the Amulet was held up and the
      order given&mdash;just as Duchesses (and other people) give it to their
      coachmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Egypt, please!&rsquo; said Anthea, when Cyril had uttered the wonderful Name
      of Power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When Moses was there,&rsquo; added Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, in the dingy Fitzroy Street dining-room, the Amulet grew big,
      and it was an arch, and through it they saw a blue, blue sky and a running
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, stop!&rsquo; said Cyril, and pulled down jane&rsquo;s hand with the Amulet in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What silly cuckoos we all are,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Of course we can&rsquo;t go. We
      daren&rsquo;t leave home for a single minute now, for fear that minute should be
      THE minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What minute be WHAT minute?&rsquo; asked Jane impatiently, trying to get her
      hand away from Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The minute when the Queen of Babylon comes,&rsquo; said Cyril. And then
      everyone saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some days life flowed in a very slow, dusty, uneventful stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children could never go out all at once, because they never knew when
      the King of Babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his Queen free to
      pay them that surprise visit to which she was, without doubt, eagerly
      looking forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they took it in turns, two and two, to go out and to stay in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stay-at-homes would have been much duller than they were but for the
      new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called Anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple and
      gold beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw one like that,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;in&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the British Museum, perhaps?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like to call the place where I saw it Babylon,&rsquo; said Anthea cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pretty fancy,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman, &lsquo;and quite correct too,
      because, as a matter of fact, these beads did come from Babylon.&rsquo; The
      other three were all out that day. The boys had been going to the Zoo, and
      Jane had said so plaintively, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am fonder of rhinoceroses than
      either of you are,&rsquo; that Anthea had told her to run along then. And she
      had run, catching the boys before that part of the road where Fitzroy
      Street suddenly becomes Fitzroy Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think Babylon is most frightfully interesting,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;I do have
      such interesting dreams about it&mdash;at least, not dreams exactly, but
      quite as wonderful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do sit down and tell me,&rsquo; said he. So she sat down and told. And he asked
      her a lot of questions, and she answered them as well as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wonderful&mdash;wonderful!&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;One&rsquo;s heard of
      thought-transference, but I never thought <i>I</i> had any power of that
      sort. Yet it must be that, and very bad for YOU, I should think. Doesn&rsquo;t
      your head ache very much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly put a cold, thin hand on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No thank you, not at all,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I assure you it is not done intentionally,&rsquo; he went on. &lsquo;Of course I know
      a good deal about Babylon, and I unconsciously communicate it to you;
      you&rsquo;ve heard of thought-reading, but some of the things you say, I don&rsquo;t
      understand; they never enter my head, and yet they&rsquo;re so astoundingly
      probable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Anthea reassuringly. &lsquo;<i>I</i> understand. And
      don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s all quite simple really.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not quite so simple when Anthea, having heard the others come in,
      went down, and before she had had time to ask how they had liked the Zoo,
      heard a noise outside, compared to which the wild beasts&rsquo; noises were
      gentle as singing birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious!&rsquo; cried Anthea, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The loud hum of many voices came through the open window. Words could be
      distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a guy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This ain&rsquo;t November. That ain&rsquo;t no guy. It&rsquo;s a ballet lady, that&rsquo;s what
      it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not it&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bloomin&rsquo; looney, I tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a clear voice that they knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Retire, slaves!&rsquo; it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s she a saying of?&rsquo; cried a dozen voices. &lsquo;Some blamed foreign
      lingo,&rsquo; one voice replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children rushed to the door. A crowd was on the road and pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the crowd, plainly to be seen from the top of the steps,
      were the beautiful face and bright veil of the Babylonian Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jimminy!&rsquo; cried Robert, and ran down the steps, &lsquo;here she is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;look out&mdash;let the lady pass. She&rsquo;s a friend of
      ours, coming to see us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nice friend for a respectable house,&rsquo; snorted a fat woman with marrows on
      a handcart.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same the crowd made way a little. The Queen met Robert on the
      pavement, and Cyril joined them, the Psammead bag still on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he whispered; &lsquo;here&rsquo;s the Psammead; you can get wishes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> wish you&rsquo;d come in a different dress, if you HAD to come,&rsquo; said
      Robert; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s no use my wishing anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;I wish I was dressed&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I wish
      THEY were dressed properly, then they wouldn&rsquo;t be so silly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead blew itself out till the bag was a very tight fit for it; and
      suddenly every man, woman, and child in that crowd felt that it had not
      enough clothes on. For, of course, the Queen&rsquo;s idea of proper dress was
      the dress that had been proper for the working-classes 3,000 years ago in
      Babylon&mdash;and there was not much of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lawky me!&rsquo; said the marrow-selling woman, &lsquo;whatever could a-took me to
      come out this figure?&rsquo; and she wheeled her cart away very quickly indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Someone&rsquo;s made a pretty guy of you&mdash;talk of guys,&rsquo; said a man who
      sold bootlaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you talk,&rsquo; said the man next to him. &lsquo;Look at your own silly
      legs; and where&rsquo;s your boots?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never come out like this, I&rsquo;ll take my sacred,&rsquo; said the
      bootlace-seller. &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t quite myself last night, I&rsquo;ll own, but not to
      dress up like a circus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was all talking at once, and getting rather angry. But no one
      seemed to think of blaming the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea bounded down the steps and pulled her up; the others followed, and
      the door was shut. &lsquo;Blowed if I can make it out!&rsquo; they heard. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off
      home, I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the crowd, coming slowly to the same mind, dispersed, followed by
      another crowd of persons who were not dressed in what the Queen thought
      was the proper way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall have the police here directly,&rsquo; said Anthea in the tones of
      despair. &lsquo;Oh, why did you come dressed like that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen leaned against the arm of the horse-hair sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How else can a queen dress I should like to know?&rsquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our Queen wears things like other people,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t. And I must say,&rsquo; she remarked in an injured tone, &lsquo;that
      you don&rsquo;t seem very glad to see me now I HAVE come. But perhaps it&rsquo;s the
      surprise that makes you behave like this. Yet you ought to be used to
      surprises. The way you vanished! I shall never forget it. The best magic
      I&rsquo;ve ever seen. How did you do it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, never mind about that now,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;You see you&rsquo;ve gone and
      upset all those people, and I expect they&rsquo;ll fetch the police. And we
      don&rsquo;t want to see you collared and put in prison.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t put queens in prison,&rsquo; she said loftily. &lsquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said
      Cyril. &lsquo;We cut off a king&rsquo;s head here once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this miserable room? How frightfully interesting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, not in this room; in history.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, in THAT,&rsquo; said the Queen disparagingly. &lsquo;I thought you&rsquo;d done it with
      your own hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a hideous city yours is,&rsquo; the Queen went on pleasantly, &lsquo;and what
      horrid, ignorant people. Do you know they actually can&rsquo;t understand a
      single word I say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you understand them?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not; they speak some vulgar, Northern dialect. I can understand
      YOU quite well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I really am not going to explain AGAIN how it was that the children could
      understand other languages than their own so thoroughly, and talk them,
      too, so that it felt and sounded (to them) just as though they were
      talking English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Cyril bluntly, &lsquo;now you&rsquo;ve seen just how horrid it is, don&rsquo;t
      you think you might as well go home again?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve seen simply nothing
      yet,&rsquo; said the Queen, arranging her starry veil. &lsquo;I wished to be at your
      door, and I was. Now I must go and see your King and Queen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody&rsquo;s allowed to,&rsquo; said Anthea in haste; &lsquo;but look here, we&rsquo;ll take
      you and show you anything you&rsquo;d like to see&mdash;anything you CAN see,&rsquo; 
      she added kindly, because she remembered how nice the Queen had been to
      them in Babylon, even if she had been a little deceitful in the matter of
      Jane and Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the Museum,&rsquo; said Cyril hopefully; &lsquo;there are lots of things from
      your country there. If only we could disguise you a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Anthea suddenly. &lsquo;Mother&rsquo;s old theatre cloak, and there are
      a lot of her old hats in the big box.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue silk, lace-trimmed cloak did indeed hide some of the Queen&rsquo;s
      startling splendours, but the hat fitted very badly. It had pink roses in
      it; and there was something about the coat or the hat or the Queen, that
      made her look somehow not very respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, never mind,&rsquo; said Anthea, when Cyril whispered this. &lsquo;The thing is to
      get her out before Nurse has finished her forty winks. I should think
      she&rsquo;s about got to the thirty-ninth wink by now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on then,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;You know how dangerous it is. Let&rsquo;s make
      haste into the Museum. If any of those people you made guys of do fetch
      the police, they won&rsquo;t think of looking for you there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue silk coat and the pink-rosed hat attracted almost as much
      attention as the royal costume had done; and the children were uncommonly
      glad to get out of the noisy streets into the grey quiet of the Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Parcels and umbrellas to be left here,&rsquo; said a man at the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party had no umbrellas, and the only parcel was the bag containing the
      Psammead, which the Queen had insisted should be brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;M not going to be left,&rsquo; said the Psammead softly, &lsquo;so don&rsquo;t you think
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait outside with you,&rsquo; said Anthea hastily, and went to sit on the
      seat near the drinking fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t sit so near that nasty fountain,&rsquo; said the creature crossly; &lsquo;I
      might get splashed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea obediently moved to another seat and waited. Indeed she waited, and
      waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. The Psammead dropped into an
      uneasy slumber. Anthea had long ceased to watch the swing-door that always
      let out the wrong person, and she was herself almost asleep, and still the
      others did not come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite a start when Anthea suddenly realized that they HAD come
      back, and that they were not alone. Behind them was quite a crowd of men
      in uniform, and several gentlemen were there. Everyone seemed very angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now go,&rsquo; said the nicest of the angry gentlemen. &lsquo;Take the poor, demented
      thing home and tell your parents she ought to be properly looked after.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t get her to go we must send for the police,&rsquo; said the
      nastiest gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we don&rsquo;t wish to use harsh measures,&rsquo; added the nice one, who was
      really very nice indeed, and seemed to be over all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I speak to my sister a moment first?&rsquo; asked Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nicest gentleman nodded, and the officials stood round the Queen, the
      others forming a sort of guard while Robert crossed over to Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything you can think of,&rsquo; he replied to Anthea&rsquo;s glance of inquiry.
      &lsquo;Kicked up the most frightful shine in there. Said those necklaces and
      earrings and things in the glass cases were all hers&mdash;would have them
      out of the cases. Tried to break the glass&mdash;she did break one bit!
      Everybody in the place has been at her. No good. I only got her out by
      telling her that was the place where they cut queens&rsquo; heads off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Bobs, what a whacker!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d have told a whackinger one to get her out. Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t. I
      meant MUMMY queens. How do you know they don&rsquo;t cut off mummies&rsquo; heads to
      see how the embalming is done? What I want to say is, can&rsquo;t you get her to
      go with you quietly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rsquo; said Anthea, and went up to the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do come home,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;the learned gentleman in our house has a much
      nicer necklace than anything they&rsquo;ve got here. Come and see it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said the nastiest gentleman, &lsquo;she does understand English.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was talking Babylonian, I think,&rsquo; said Anthea bashfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good child,&rsquo; said the nice gentleman, &lsquo;what you&rsquo;re talking is not
      Babylonian, but nonsense. You just go home at once, and tell your parents
      exactly what has happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea took the Queen&rsquo;s hand and gently pulled her away. The other
      children followed, and the black crowd of angry gentlemen stood on the
      steps watching them. It was when the little party of disgraced children,
      with the Queen who had disgraced them, had reached the middle of the
      courtyard that her eyes fell on the bag where the Psammead was. She
      stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; she said, very loud and clear, &lsquo;that all those Babylonian things
      would come out to me here&mdash;slowly, so that those dogs and slaves can
      see the working of the great Queen&rsquo;s magic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you ARE a tiresome woman,&rsquo; said the Psammead in its bag, but it
      puffed itself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment there was a crash. The glass swing doors and all their
      framework were smashed suddenly and completely. The crowd of angry
      gentlemen sprang aside when they saw what had done this.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the nastiest of them was not quick enough, and he was roughly pushed
      out of the way by an enormous stone bull that was floating steadily
      through the door. It came and stood beside the Queen in the middle of the
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was followed by more stone images, by great slabs of carved stone,
      bricks, helmets, tools, weapons, fetters, wine-jars, bowls, bottles,
      vases, jugs, saucers, seals, and the round long things, something like
      rolling pins with marks on them like the print of little bird-feet,
      necklaces, collars, rings, armlets, earrings&mdash;heaps and heaps and
      heaps of things, far more than anyone had time to count, or even to see
      distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the angry gentlemen had abruptly sat down on the Museum steps except
      the nice one. He stood with his hands in his pockets just as though he was
      quite used to seeing great stone bulls and all sorts of small Babylonish
      objects float out into the Museum yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he sent a man to close the big iron gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      A journalist, who was just leaving the museum, spoke to Robert as he
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Theosophy, I suppose?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Is she Mrs Besant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YES,&rsquo; said Robert recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist passed through the gates just before they were shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed off to Fleet Street, and his paper got out a new edition within
      half an hour.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   MRS BESANT AND THEOSOPHY

   IMPERTINENT MIRACLE AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
</pre>
    <p>
      People saw it in fat, black letters on the boards carried by the sellers
      of newspapers. Some few people who had nothing better to do went down to
      the Museum on the tops of omnibuses. But by the time they got there there
      was nothing to be seen. For the Babylonian Queen had suddenly seen the
      closed gates, had felt the threat of them, and had said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we were in your house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, instantly they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll come after you, and they&rsquo;ll find ME.
      There&rsquo;ll be a National Cage built for me at Westminster, and I shall have
      to work at politics. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you leave the things in their places?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a temper you have, haven&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said the Queen serenely. &lsquo;I wish
      all the things were back in their places. Will THAT do for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead swelled and shrank and spoke very angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t refuse to give your wishes,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;but I can Bite. And I will
      if this goes on. Now then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; whispered Anthea close to its bristling ear; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s dreadful
      for us too. Don&rsquo;t YOU desert us. Perhaps she&rsquo;ll wish herself at home again
      soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not she,&rsquo; said the Psammead a little less crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take me to see your City,&rsquo; said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we had some money we could take her about in a cab. People wouldn&rsquo;t
      notice her so much then. But we haven&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sell this,&rsquo; said the Queen, taking a ring from her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;d only think we&rsquo;d stolen it,&rsquo; said Cyril bitterly, &lsquo;and put us in
      prison.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All roads lead to prison with you, it seems,&rsquo; said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The learned gentleman!&rsquo; said Anthea, and ran up to him with the ring in
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;will you buy this for a pound?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he said in tones of joy and amazement, and took the ring into his
      hand. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my very own,&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;it was given to me to sell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you a pound,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman, &lsquo;with pleasure; and
      I&rsquo;ll take care of the ring for you. Who did you say gave it to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We call her,&rsquo; said Anthea carefully, &lsquo;the Queen of Babylon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it a game?&rsquo; he asked hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be a pretty game if I don&rsquo;t get the money to pay for cabs for her,&rsquo; 
      said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sometimes think,&rsquo; he said slowly, &lsquo;that I am becoming insane, or that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or that I am; but I&rsquo;m not, and you&rsquo;re not, and she&rsquo;s not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does she SAY that she&rsquo;s the Queen of Babylon?&rsquo; he uneasily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anthea recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This thought-transference is more far-reaching than I imagined,&rsquo; he said.
      &lsquo;I suppose I have unconsciously influenced HER, too. I never thought my
      Babylonish studies would bear fruit like this. Horrible! There are more
      things in heaven and earth&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;heaps more. And the pound is the thing <i>I</i> want
      more than anything on earth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran his fingers through his thin hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This thought-transference!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s undoubtedly a Babylonian ring&mdash;or
      it seems so to me. But perhaps I have hypnotized myself. I will see a
      doctor the moment I have corrected the last proofs of my book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, do!&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;and thank you so very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the sovereign and ran down to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now from the window of a four-wheeled cab the Queen of Babylon beheld
      the wonders of London. Buckingham Palace she thought uninteresting;
      Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament little better. But she
      liked the Tower, and the River, and the ships filled her with wonder and
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how badly you keep your slaves. How wretched and poor and neglected
      they seem,&rsquo; she said, as the cab rattled along the Mile End Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They aren&rsquo;t slaves; they&rsquo;re working-people,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course they&rsquo;re working. That&rsquo;s what slaves are. Don&rsquo;t you tell me. Do
      you suppose I don&rsquo;t know a slave&rsquo;s face when I see it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why don&rsquo;t their masters see that they&rsquo;re better fed and better clothed?
      Tell me in three words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No one answered. The wage-system of modern England is a little difficult
      to explain in three words even if you understand it&mdash;which the
      children didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have a revolt of your slaves if you&rsquo;re not careful,&rsquo; said the
      Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;you see they have votes&mdash;that makes them safe
      not to revolt. It makes all the difference. Father told me so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this vote?&rsquo; asked the Queen. &lsquo;Is it a charm? What do they do with
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said the harassed Cyril; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just a vote, that&rsquo;s all!
      They don&rsquo;t do anything particular with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said the Queen; &lsquo;a sort of plaything. Well, I wish that all these
      slaves may have in their hands this moment their fill of their favourite
      meat and drink.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly all the people in the Mile End Road, and in all the other
      streets where poor people live, found their hands full of things to eat
      and drink. From the cab window could be seen persons carrying every kind
      of food, and bottles and cans as well. Roast meat, fowls, red lobsters,
      great yellowy crabs, fried fish, boiled pork, beef-steak puddings, baked
      onions, mutton pies; most of the young people had oranges and sweets and
      cake. It made an enormous change in the look of the Mile End Road&mdash;brightened
      it up, so to speak, and brightened up, more than you can possibly imagine,
      the faces of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Makes a difference, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the best wish you&rsquo;ve had yet,&rsquo; said Jane with cordial approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      just by the Bank the cabman stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to drive you no further,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Out you gets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They got out rather unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wants my tea,&rsquo; he said; and they saw that on the box of the cab was a
      mound of cabbage, with pork chops and apple sauce, a duck, and a spotted
      currant pudding. Also a large can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You pay me my fare,&rsquo; he said threateningly, and looked down at the mound,
      muttering again about his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll take another cab,&rsquo; said Cyril with dignity. &lsquo;Give me change for a
      sovereign, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cabman, as it turned out, was not at all a nice character. He took
      the sovereign, whipped up his horse, and disappeared in the stream of cabs
      and omnibuses and wagons, without giving them any change at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already a little crowd was collecting round the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Robert, leading the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd round them thickened. They were in a narrow street where many
      gentlemen in black coats and without hats were standing about on the
      pavement talking very loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How ugly their clothes are,&rsquo; said the Queen of Babylon. &lsquo;They&rsquo;d be rather
      fine men, some of them, if they were dressed decently, especially the ones
      with the beautiful long, curved noses. I wish they were dressed like the
      Babylonians of my court.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course, it was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the almost fainting Psammead had blown itself out every man in
      Throgmorton Street appeared abruptly in Babylonian full dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were carefully powdered, their hair and beards were scented and
      curled, their garments richly embroidered. They wore rings and armlets,
      flat gold collars and swords, and impossible-looking head-dresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stupefied silence fell on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; a youth who had always been fair-haired broke that silence, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      only fancy of course&mdash;something wrong with my eyes&mdash;but you
      chaps do look so rum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rum,&rsquo; said his friend. &lsquo;Look at YOU. You in a sash! My hat! And your
      hair&rsquo;s gone black and you&rsquo;ve got a beard. It&rsquo;s my belief we&rsquo;ve been
      poisoned. You do look a jackape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Levinstein don&rsquo;t look so bad. But how was it DONE&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I
      want to know. How was it done? Is it conjuring, or what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it is chust a ver&rsquo; bad tream,&rsquo; said old Levinstein to his clerk;
      &lsquo;all along Bishopsgate I haf seen the gommon people have their hants full
      of food&mdash;GOOT food. Oh yes, without doubt a very bad tream!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;m dreaming too, Sir,&rsquo; said the clerk, looking down at his legs
      with an expression of loathing. &lsquo;I see my feet in beastly sandals as plain
      as plain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All that goot food wasted,&rsquo; said old Mr Levinstein. A bad tream&mdash;a
      bad tream.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Members of the Stock Exchange are said to be at all times a noisy lot.
      But the noise they made now to express their disgust at the costumes of
      ancient Babylon was far louder than their ordinary row. One had to shout
      before one could hear oneself speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only wish,&rsquo; said the clerk who thought it was conjuring&mdash;he was
      quite close to the children and they trembled, because they knew that
      whatever he wished would come true. &lsquo;I only wish we knew who&rsquo;d done it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, instantly they did know, and they pressed round the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scandalous! Shameful! Ought to be put down by law. Give her in charge.
      Fetch the police,&rsquo; two or three voices shouted at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;They sound like caged lions&mdash;lions by the
      thousand. What is it that they say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They say &ldquo;Police!&rdquo;,&rsquo; said Cyril briefly. &lsquo;I knew they would sooner or
      later. And I don&rsquo;t blame them, mind you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish my guards were here!&rsquo; cried the Queen. The exhausted Psammead was
      panting and trembling, but the Queen&rsquo;s guards in red and green garments,
      and brass and iron gear, choked Throgmorton Street, and bared weapons
      flashed round the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m mad,&rsquo; said a Mr Rosenbaum; &lsquo;dat&rsquo;s what it is&mdash;mad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a judgement on you, Rosy,&rsquo; said his partner. &lsquo;I always said you were
      too hard in that matter of Flowerdew. It&rsquo;s a judgement, and I&rsquo;m in it
      too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The members of the Stock Exchange had edged carefully away from the
      gleaming blades, the mailed figures, the hard, cruel Eastern faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Throgmorton Street is narrow, and the crowd was too thick for them to
      get away as quickly as they wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kill them,&rsquo; cried the Queen. &lsquo;Kill the dogs!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The guards obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It IS all a dream,&rsquo; cried Mr Levinstein, cowering in a doorway behind his
      clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the clerk. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t. Oh, my good gracious! those foreign
      brutes are killing everybody. Henry Hirsh is down now, and Prentice is cut
      in two&mdash;oh, Lord! and Huth, and there goes Lionel Cohen with his head
      off, and Guy Nickalls has lost his head now. A dream? I wish to goodness
      it was all a dream.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, instantly it was! The entire Stock Exchange rubbed its
      eyes and went back to close, to over, and either side of seven-eights, and
      Trunks, and Kaffirs, and Steel Common, and Contangoes, and Backwardations,
      Double Options, and all the interesting subjects concerning which they
      talk in the Street without ceasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one said a word about it to anyone else. I think I have explained
      before that business men do not like it to be known that they have been
      dreaming in business hours. Especially mad dreams including such dreadful
      things as hungry people getting dinners, and the destruction of the Stock
      Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street, pale and
      trembling. The Psammead crawled out of the embroidered bag, and lay flat
      on the table, its leg stretched out, looking more like a dead hare than
      anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank Goodness that&rsquo;s over,&rsquo; said Anthea, drawing a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t come back, will she?&rsquo; asked Jane tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s thousands of years ago. But we spent a whole
      precious pound on her. It&rsquo;ll take all our pocket-money for ages to pay
      that back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if it was ALL a dream,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wish said ALL a dream, you know, Panther; you cut up and ask if he
      lent you anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Anthea politely, following the sound of her
      knock into the presence of the learned gentleman, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry to trouble
      you, but DID you lend me a pound today?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, looking kindly at her through his spectacles. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s
      extraordinary that you should ask me, for I dozed for a few moments this
      afternoon, a thing I very rarely do, and I dreamed quite distinctly that
      you brought me a ring that you said belonged to the Queen of Babylon, and
      that I lent you a sovereign and that you left one of the Queen&rsquo;s rings
      here. The ring was a magnificent specimen.&rsquo; He sighed. &lsquo;I wish it hadn&rsquo;t
      been a dream,&rsquo; he said smiling. He was really learning to smile quite
      nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea could not be too thankful that the Psammead was not there to grant
      his wish.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 9. ATLANTIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      You will understand that the adventure of the Babylonian queen in London
      was the only one that had occupied any time at all. But the children&rsquo;s
      time was very fully taken up by talking over all the wonderful things seen
      and done in the Past, where, by the power of the Amulet, they seemed to
      spend hours and hours, only to find when they got back to London that the
      whole thing had been briefer than a lightning flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of the Past at their meals, in their walks, in the
      dining-room, in the first-floor drawing-room, but most of all on the
      stairs. It was an old house; it had once been a fashionable one, and was a
      fine one still. The banister rails of the stairs were excellent for
      sliding down, and in the corners of the landings were big alcoves that had
      once held graceful statues, and now quite often held the graceful forms of
      Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Cyril and Robert in tight white underclothing had spent a pleasant
      hour in reproducing the attitudes of statues seen either in the British
      Museum, or in Father&rsquo;s big photograph book. But the show ended abruptly
      because Robert wanted to be the Venus of Milo, and for this purpose pulled
      at the sheet which served for drapery at the very moment when Cyril,
      looking really quite like the Discobolos&mdash;with a gold and white
      saucer for the disc&mdash;was standing on one foot, and under that one
      foot was the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the Discobolos and his disc and the would-be Venus came down
      together, and everyone was a good deal hurt, especially the saucer, which
      would never be the same again, however neatly one might join its uneven
      bits with Seccotine or the white of an egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;re satisfied,&rsquo; said Cyril, holding his head where a large lump
      was rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite, thanks,&rsquo; said Robert bitterly. His thumb had caught in the
      banisters and bent itself back almost to breaking point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I AM so sorry, poor, dear Squirrel,&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;and you were looking
      so lovely. I&rsquo;ll get a wet rag. Bobs, go and hold your hand under the
      hot-water tap. It&rsquo;s what ballet girls do with their legs when they hurt
      them. I saw it in a book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What book?&rsquo; said Robert disagreeably. But he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came back Cyril&rsquo;s head had been bandaged by his sisters, and he
      had been brought to the state of mind where he was able reluctantly to
      admit that he supposed Robert hadn&rsquo;t done it on purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert replying with equal suavity, Anthea hastened to lead the talk away
      from the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t feel like going anywhere through the Amulet,&rsquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Egypt!&rsquo; said Jane promptly. &lsquo;I want to see the pussy cats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not me&mdash;too hot,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s about as much as I can stand
      here&mdash;let alone Egypt.&rsquo; It was indeed, hot, even on the second
      landing, which was the coolest place in the house. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the North
      Pole.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose the Amulet was ever there&mdash;and we might get our
      fingers frost-bitten so that we could never hold it up to get home again.
      No thanks,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s get the Psammead and ask its advice. It will
      like us asking, even if we don&rsquo;t take it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead was brought up in its green silk embroidered bag, but before
      it could be asked anything the door of the learned gentleman&rsquo;s room opened
      and the voice of the visitor who had been lunching with him was heard on
      the stairs. He seemed to be speaking with the door handle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see a doctor, old boy,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;all that about thought-transference
      is just simply twaddle. You&rsquo;ve been over-working. Take a holiday. Go to
      Dieppe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather go to Babylon,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you&rsquo;d go to Atlantis some time, while we&rsquo;re about it, so as to
      give me some tips for my Nineteenth Century article when you come home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could,&rsquo; said the voice of the learned gentleman. &lsquo;Goodbye. Take
      care of yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was banged, and the visitor came smiling down the stairs&mdash;a
      stout, prosperous, big man. The children had to get up to let him pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo, Kiddies,&rsquo; he said, glancing at the bandages on the head of Cyril
      and the hand of Robert, &lsquo;been in the wars?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;I say, what was that Atlantic place you
      wanted him to go to? We couldn&rsquo;t help hearing you talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You talk so VERY loud, you see,&rsquo; said Jane soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Atlantis,&rsquo; said the visitor, &lsquo;the lost Atlantis, garden of the
      Hesperides. Great continent&mdash;disappeared in the sea. You can read
      about it in Plato.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Cyril doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were there any Amulets there?&rsquo; asked Anthea, made anxious by a sudden
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hundreds, I should think. So HE&rsquo;S been talking to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, often. He&rsquo;s very kind to us. We like him awfully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what he wants is a holiday; you persuade him to take one. What he
      wants is a change of scene. You see, his head is crusted so thickly inside
      with knowledge about Egypt and Assyria and things that you can&rsquo;t hammer
      anything into it unless you keep hard at it all day long for days and
      days. And I haven&rsquo;t time. But you live in the house. You can hammer almost
      incessantly. Just try your hands, will you? Right. So long!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down the stairs three at a time, and Jane remarked that he was a
      nice man, and she thought he had little girls of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to have them to play with,&rsquo; she added pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three elder ones exchanged glances. Cyril nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right. LET&rsquo;S go to Atlantis,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Atlantis and take the learned gentleman with us,&rsquo; said
      Anthea; &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s a dream, afterwards, but it&rsquo;ll certainly be a
      change of scene.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not take him to nice Egypt?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too hot,&rsquo; said Cyril shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or Babylon, where he wants to go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of Babylon,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;at least for the present. And
      so have the others. I don&rsquo;t know why,&rsquo; he added, forestalling the question
      on Jane&rsquo;s lips, &lsquo;but somehow we have. Squirrel, let&rsquo;s take off these
      beastly bandages and get into flannels. We can&rsquo;t go in our unders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He WISHED to go to Atlantis, so he&rsquo;s got to go some time; and he might as
      well go with us,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how it was that the learned gentleman, permitting himself a few
      moments of relaxation in his chair, after the fatigue of listening to
      opinions (about Atlantis and many other things) with which he did not at
      all agree, opened his eyes to find his four young friends standing in
      front of him in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you come,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;to Atlantis with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To know that you are dreaming shows that the dream is nearly at an end,&rsquo; 
      he told himself; &lsquo;or perhaps it&rsquo;s only a game, like &ldquo;How many miles to
      Babylon?&rdquo;.&rsquo; So he said aloud: &lsquo;Thank you very much, but I have only a
      quarter of an hour to spare.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take any time,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;time is only a mode of thought,
      you know, and you&rsquo;ve got to go some time, so why not with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman, now quite certain that he was
      dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea held out her soft, pink hand. He took it. She pulled him gently to
      his feet. Jane held up the Amulet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To just outside Atlantis,&rsquo; said Cyril, and Jane said the Name of Power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You owl!&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s an island. Outside an island&rsquo;s all water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t go. I WON&rsquo;T,&rsquo; said the Psammead, kicking and struggling in its
      bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      But already the Amulet had grown to a great arch. Cyril pushed the learned
      gentleman, as undoubtedly the first-born, through the arch&mdash;not into
      water, but on to a wooden floor, out of doors. The others followed. The
      Amulet grew smaller again, and there they all were, standing on the deck
      of a ship whose sailors were busy making her fast with chains to rings on
      a white quay-side. The rings and the chains were of a metal that shone
      red-yellow like gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone on the ship seemed too busy at first to notice the group of
      newcomers from Fitzroy Street. Those who seemed to be officers were
      shouting orders to the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood and looked across the wide quay to the town that rose beyond
      it. What they saw was the most beautiful sight any of them had ever seen&mdash;or
      ever dreamed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue sea sparkled in soft sunlight; little white-capped waves broke
      softly against the marble breakwaters that guarded the shipping of a great
      city from the wilderness of winter winds and seas. The quay was of marble,
      white and sparkling with a veining bright as gold. The city was of marble,
      red and white. The greater buildings that seemed to be temples and palaces
      were roofed with what looked like gold and silver, but most of the roofs
      were of copper that glowed golden-red on the houses on the hills among
      which the city stood, and shaded into marvellous tints of green and blue
      and purple where they had been touched by the salt sea spray and the fumes
      of the dyeing and smelting works of the lower town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broad and magnificent flights of marble stairs led up from the quay to a
      sort of terrace that seemed to run along for miles, and beyond rose the
      town built on a hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman drew a long breath. &lsquo;Wonderful!&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;wonderful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Mr&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;He means,&rsquo; said Anthea,
      with gentle politeness, &lsquo;that we never can remember your name. I know it&rsquo;s
      Mr De Something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I was your age I was called Jimmy,&rsquo; he said timidly. &lsquo;Would you
      mind? I should feel more at home in a dream like this if I&mdash;Anything
      that made me seem more like one of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you&mdash;Jimmy,&rsquo; said Anthea with an effort. It seemed such a
      cheek to be saying Jimmy to a grown-up man. &lsquo;Jimmy, DEAR,&rsquo; she added, with
      no effort at all. Jimmy smiled and looked pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the ship was made fast, and the Captain had time to notice other
      things. He came towards them, and he was dressed in the best of all
      possible dresses for the seafaring life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo; he asked rather fiercely. &lsquo;Do you come to bless
      or to curse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To bless, of course,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if it annoys you, but we&rsquo;re
      here by magic. We come from the land of the sun-rising,&rsquo; he went on
      explanatorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said the Captain; no one had expected that he would. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      notice at first, but of course I hope you&rsquo;re a good omen. It&rsquo;s needed. And
      this,&rsquo; he pointed to the learned gentleman, &lsquo;your slave, I presume?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a very great man. A sage, don&rsquo;t they call
      it? And we want to see all your beautiful city, and your temples and
      things, and then we shall go back, and he will tell his friend, and his
      friend will write a book about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; asked the Captain, fingering a rope, &lsquo;is a book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A record&mdash;something written, or,&rsquo; she added hastily, remembering the
      Babylonian writing, &lsquo;or engraved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some sudden impulse of confidence made Jane pluck the Amulet from the neck
      of her frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like this,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked at it curiously, but, the other three were relieved to
      notice, without any of that overwhelming interest which the mere name of
      it had roused in Egypt and Babylon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The stone is of our country,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and that which is engraved on it,
      it is like our writing, but I cannot read it. What is the name of your
      sage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ji-jimmy,&rsquo; said Anthea hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain repeated, &lsquo;Ji-jimmy. Will you land?&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;And shall I
      lead you to the Kings?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;does your King hate strangers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our Kings are ten,&rsquo; said the Captain, &lsquo;and the Royal line, unbroken from
      Poseidon, the father of us all, has the noble tradition to do honour to
      strangers if they come in peace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then lead on, please,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;though I SHOULD like to see all over
      your beautiful ship, and sail about in her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shall be later,&rsquo; said the Captain; &lsquo;just now we&rsquo;re afraid of a storm&mdash;do
      you notice that odd rumbling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing, master,&rsquo; said an old sailor who stood near; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the
      pilchards coming in, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too loud,&rsquo; said the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rather anxious pause; then the Captain stepped on to the quay,
      and the others followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do talk to him&mdash;Jimmy,&rsquo; said Anthea as they went; &lsquo;you can find out
      all sorts of things for your friend&rsquo;s book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please excuse me,&rsquo; he said earnestly. &lsquo;If I talk I shall wake up; and
      besides, I can&rsquo;t understand what he says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No one else could think of anything to say, so that it was in complete
      silence that they followed the Captain up the marble steps and through the
      streets of the town. There were streets and shops and houses and markets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just like Babylon,&rsquo; whispered Jane, &lsquo;only everything&rsquo;s perfectly
      different.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a great comfort the ten Kings have been properly brought up&mdash;to
      be kind to strangers,&rsquo; Anthea whispered to Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;no deepest dungeons here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no horses or chariots in the street, but there were handcarts
      and low trolleys running on thick log-wheels, and porters carrying packets
      on their heads, and a good many of the people were riding on what looked
      like elephants, only the great beasts were hairy, and they had not that
      mild expression we are accustomed to meet on the faces of the elephants at
      the Zoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mammoths!&rsquo; murmured the learned gentleman, and stumbled over a loose
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people in the streets kept crowding round them as they went along, but
      the Captain always dispersed the crowd before it grew uncomfortably thick
      by saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Children of the Sun God and their High Priest&mdash;come to bless the
      City.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the people would draw back with a low murmur that sounded like a
      suppressed cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the buildings were covered with gold, but the gold on the bigger
      buildings was of a different colour, and they had sorts of steeples of
      burnished silver rising above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are all these houses real gold?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The temples are covered with gold, of course,&rsquo; answered the Captain, &lsquo;but
      the houses are only oricalchum. It&rsquo;s not quite so expensive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman, now very pale, stumbled along in a dazed way,
      repeating:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oricalchum&mdash;oricalchum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;we can get home in a minute, just by
      holding up the charm. Would you rather go back now? We could easily come
      some other day without you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, no,&rsquo; he pleaded fervently; &lsquo;let the dream go on. Please, please
      do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The High Ji-jimmy is perhaps weary with his magic journey,&rsquo; said the
      Captain, noticing the blundering walk of the learned gentleman; &lsquo;and we
      are yet very far from the Great Temple, where today the Kings make
      sacrifice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped at the gate of a great enclosure. It seemed to be a sort of
      park, for trees showed high above its brazen wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party waited, and almost at once the Captain came back with one of the
      hairy elephants and begged them to mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      This they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious ride. The elephant at the Zoo&mdash;to ride on him is
      also glorious, but he goes such a very little way, and then he goes back
      again, which is always dull. But this great hairy beast went on and on and
      on along streets and through squares and gardens. It was a glorious city;
      almost everything was built of marble, red, or white, or black. Every now
      and then the party crossed a bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till they had climbed to the hill which is the centre of the
      town that they saw that the whole city was divided into twenty circles,
      alternately land and water, and over each of the water circles were the
      bridges by which they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now they were in a great square. A vast building filled up one side of
      it; it was overlaid with gold, and had a dome of silver. The rest of the
      buildings round the square were of oricalchum. And it looked more splendid
      than you can possibly imagine, standing up bold and shining in the
      sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would like a bath,&rsquo; said the Captain, as the hairy elephant went
      clumsily down on his knees. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s customary, you know, before entering the
      Presence. We have baths for men, women, horses, and cattle. The High Class
      Baths are here. Our Father Poseidon gave us a spring of hot water and one
      of cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children had never before bathed in baths of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It feels very splendid,&rsquo; said Cyril, splashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least, of course, it&rsquo;s not gold; it&rsquo;s or&mdash;what&rsquo;s its name,&rsquo; said
      Robert. &lsquo;Hand over that towel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bathing hall had several great pools sunk below the level of the
      floor; one went down to them by steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jimmy,&rsquo; said Anthea timidly, when, very clean and boiled-looking, they
      all met in the flowery courtyard of the Public, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you think all this
      seems much more like NOW than Babylon or Egypt&mdash;? Oh, I forgot,
      you&rsquo;ve never been there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know a little of those nations, however,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and I quite agree
      with you. A most discerning remark&mdash;my dear,&rsquo; he added awkwardly;
      &lsquo;this city certainly seems to indicate a far higher level of civilization
      than the Egyptian or Babylonish, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Follow me,&rsquo; said the Captain. &lsquo;Now, boys, get out of the way.&rsquo; He pushed
      through a little crowd of boys who were playing with dried chestnuts
      fastened to a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ginger!&rsquo; remarked Robert, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re playing conkers, just like the kids in
      Kentish Town Road!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They could see now that three walls surrounded the island on which they
      were. The outermost wall was of brass, the Captain told them; the next,
      which looked like silver, was covered with tin; and the innermost one was
      of oricalchum.
    </p>
    <p>
      And right in the middle was a wall of gold, with golden towers and gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Behold the Temples of Poseidon,&rsquo; said the Captain. &lsquo;It is not lawful for
      me to enter. I will await your return here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He told them what they ought to say, and the five people from Fitzroy
      Street took hands and went forward. The golden gates slowly opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are the children of the Sun,&rsquo; said Cyril, as he had been told, &lsquo;and
      our High Priest, at least that&rsquo;s what the Captain calls him. We have a
      different name for him at home.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is his name?&rsquo; asked a white-robed
      man who stood in the doorway with his arms extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ji-jimmy,&rsquo; replied Cyril, and he hesitated as Anthea had done. It really
      did seem to be taking a great liberty with so learned a gentleman. &lsquo;And we
      have come to speak with your Kings in the Temple of Poseidon&mdash;does
      that word sound right?&rsquo; he whispered anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very odd I can understand what
      you say to them, but not what they say to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Queen of Babylon found that too,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s part of the
      magic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what a dream!&rsquo; said the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white-robed priest had been joined by others, and all were bowing low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enter,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;enter, Children of the Sun, with your High Ji-jimmy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In an inner courtyard stood the Temple&mdash;all of silver, with gold
      pinnacles and doors, and twenty enormous statues in bright gold of men and
      women. Also an immense pillar of the other precious yellow metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went through the doors, and the priest led them up a stair into a
      gallery from which they could look down on to the glorious place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The ten Kings are even now choosing the bull. It is not lawful for me to
      behold,&rsquo; said the priest, and fell face downward on the floor outside the
      gallery. The children looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roof was of ivory adorned with the three precious metals, and the
      walls were lined with the favourite oricalchum.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the far end of the Temple was a statue group, the like of which no one
      living has ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of gold, and the head of the chief figure reached to the roof. That
      figure was Poseidon, the Father of the City. He stood in a great chariot
      drawn by six enormous horses, and round about it were a hundred mermaids
      riding on dolphins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten men, splendidly dressed and armed only with sticks and ropes, were
      trying to capture one of some fifteen bulls who ran this way and that
      about the floor of the Temple. The children held their breath, for the
      bulls looked dangerous, and the great horned heads were swinging more and
      more wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea did not like looking at the bulls. She looked about the gallery,
      and noticed that another staircase led up from it to a still higher
      storey; also that a door led out into the open air, where there seemed to
      be a balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that when a shout went up and Robert whispered, &lsquo;Got him,&rsquo; and she
      looked down and saw the herd of bulls being driven out of the Temple by
      whips, and the ten Kings following, one of them spurring with his stick a
      black bull that writhed and fought in the grip of a lasso, she answered
      the boy&rsquo;s agitated, &lsquo;Now we shan&rsquo;t see anything more,&rsquo; with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes we can, there&rsquo;s an outside balcony.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they crowded out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But very soon the girls crept back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like sacrifices,&rsquo; Jane said. So she and Anthea went and talked to
      the priest, who was no longer lying on his face, but sitting on the top
      step mopping his forehead with his robe, for it was a hot day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a special sacrifice,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;usually it&rsquo;s only done on the
      justice days every five years and six years alternately. And then they
      drink the cup of wine with some of the bull&rsquo;s blood in it, and swear to
      judge truly. And they wear the sacred blue robe, and put out all the
      Temple fires. But this today is because the City&rsquo;s so upset by the odd
      noises from the sea, and the god inside the big mountain speaking with his
      thunder-voice. But all that&rsquo;s happened so often before. If anything could
      make ME uneasy it wouldn&rsquo;t be THAT.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would it be?&rsquo; asked Jane kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be the Lemmings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are they&mdash;enemies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re a sort of rat; and every year they come swimming over from the
      country that no man knows, and stay here awhile, and then swim away. This
      year they haven&rsquo;t come. You know rats won&rsquo;t stay on a ship that&rsquo;s going to
      be wrecked. If anything horrible were going to happen to us, it&rsquo;s my
      belief those Lemmings would know; and that may be why they&rsquo;ve fought shy
      of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you call this country?&rsquo; asked the Psammead, suddenly putting its
      head out of its bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Atlantis,&rsquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I advise you to get on to the highest ground you can find. I
      remember hearing something about a flood here. Look here, you&rsquo;&mdash;it
      turned to Anthea; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s get home. The prospect&rsquo;s too wet for my
      whiskers.&rsquo; The girls obediently went to find their brothers, who were
      leaning on the balcony railings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the learned gentleman?&rsquo; asked Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There he is&mdash;below,&rsquo; said the priest, who had come with them. &lsquo;Your
      High Ji-jimmy is with the Kings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ten Kings were no longer alone. The learned gentleman&mdash;no one had
      noticed how he got there&mdash;stood with them on the steps of an altar,
      on which lay the dead body of the black bull. All the rest of the
      courtyard was thick with people, seemingly of all classes, and all were
      shouting, &lsquo;The sea&mdash;the sea!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be calm,&rsquo; said the most kingly of the Kings, he who had lassoed the bull.
      &lsquo;Our town is strong against the thunders of the sea and of the sky!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to go home,&rsquo; whined the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go without HIM,&rsquo; said Anthea firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jimmy,&rsquo; she called, &lsquo;Jimmy!&rsquo; and waved to him. He heard her, and began to
      come towards her through the crowd. They could see from the balcony the
      sea-captain edging his way out from among the people. And his face was
      dead white, like paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the hills!&rsquo; he cried in a loud and terrible voice. And above his voice
      came another voice, louder, more terrible&mdash;the voice of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the smooth distance of the sea something huge and black rolled
      towards the town. It was a wave, but a wave a hundred feet in height, a
      wave that looked like a mountain&mdash;a wave rising higher and higher
      till suddenly it seemed to break in two&mdash;one half of it rushed out to
      sea again; the other&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Anthea, &lsquo;the town&mdash;the poor people!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all thousands of years ago, really,&rsquo; said Robert but his voice
      trembled. They hid their eyes for a moment. They could not bear to look
      down, for the wave had broken on the face of the town, sweeping over the
      quays and docks, overwhelming the great storehouses and factories, tearing
      gigantic stones from forts and bridges, and using them as battering rams
      against the temples. Great ships were swept over the roofs of the houses
      and dashed down halfway up the hill among ruined gardens and broken
      buildings. The water ground brown fishing-boats to powder on the golden
      roofs of Palaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wave swept back towards the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to go home,&rsquo; cried the Psammead fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rsquo; said Jane, and the boys were ready&mdash;but the learned
      gentleman had not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly they heard him dash up to the inner gallery, crying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I MUST see the end of the dream.&rsquo; He rushed up the higher flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others followed him. They found themselves in a sort of turret&mdash;roofed,
      but open to the air at the sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman was leaning on the parapet, and as they rejoined him
      the vast wave rushed back on the town. This time it rose higher&mdash;destroyed
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come home,&rsquo; cried the Psammead; &lsquo;THAT&rsquo;S the LAST, I know it is! That&rsquo;s
      the last&mdash;over there.&rsquo; It pointed with a claw that trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, come!&rsquo; cried Jane, holding up the Amulet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I WILL SEE the end of the dream,&rsquo; cried the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never see anything else if you do,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;Oh, JIMMY!&rsquo; 
      appealed Anthea. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll NEVER bring you out again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never have the chance if you don&rsquo;t go soon,&rsquo; said the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I WILL see the end of the dream,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman obstinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hills around were black with people fleeing from the villages to the
      mountains. And even as they fled thin smoke broke from the great white
      peak, and then a faint flash of flame. Then the volcano began to throw up
      its mysterious fiery inside parts. The earth trembled; ashes and sulphur
      showered down; a rain of fine pumice-stone fell like snow on all the dry
      land. The elephants from the forest rushed up towards the peaks; great
      lizards thirty yards long broke from the mountain pools and rushed down
      towards the sea. The snows melted and rushed down, first in avalanches,
      then in roaring torrents. Great rocks cast up by the volcano fell
      splashing in the sea miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, this is horrible!&rsquo; cried Anthea. &lsquo;Come home, come home!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The end of the dream,&rsquo; gasped the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold up the Amulet,&rsquo; cried the Psammead suddenly. The place where they
      stood was now crowded with men and women, and the children were strained
      tight against the parapet. The turret rocked and swayed; the wave had
      reached the golden wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane held up the Amulet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; cried the Psammead, &lsquo;say the word!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Jane said it the Psammead leaped from its bag and bit the hand of
      the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the boys pushed him through the arch and all followed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to look back, and through the arch he saw nothing but a waste of
      waters, with above it the peak of the terrible mountain with fire raging
      from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He staggered back to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a ghastly dream!&rsquo; he gasped. &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re here, my&mdash;er&mdash;dears.
      Can I do anything for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve hurt your hand,&rsquo; said Anthea gently; &lsquo;let me bind it up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand was indeed bleeding rather badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead had crept back to its bag. All the children were very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never again,&rsquo; said the Psammead later on, &lsquo;will I go into the Past with a
      grown-up person! I will say for you four, you do do as you&rsquo;re told.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t even find the Amulet,&rsquo; said Anthea later still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t; it wasn&rsquo;t there. Only the stone it was made of was
      there. It fell on to a ship miles away that managed to escape and got to
      Egypt. <i>I</i> could have told you that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you had,&rsquo; said Anthea, and her voice was still rather shaky. &lsquo;Why
      didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You never asked me,&rsquo; said the Psammead very sulkily. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not the sort of
      chap to go shoving my oar in where it&rsquo;s not wanted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Ji-jimmy&rsquo;s friend will have something worth having to put in his
      article now,&rsquo; said Cyril very much later indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not he,&rsquo; said Robert sleepily. &lsquo;The learned Ji-jimmy will think it&rsquo;s a
      dream, and it&rsquo;s ten to one he never tells the other chap a word about it
      at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert was quite right on both points. The learned gentleman did. And he
      never did.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 10. THE LITTLE BLACK GIRL AND JULIUS CAESAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      A great city swept away by the sea, a beautiful country devastated by an
      active volcano&mdash;these are not the sort of things you see every day of
      the week. And when you do see them, no matter how many other wonders you
      may have seen in your time, such sights are rather apt to take your breath
      away. Atlantis had certainly this effect on the breaths of Cyril, Robert,
      Anthea, and Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained in a breathless state for some days. The learned gentleman
      seemed as breathless as anyone; he spent a good deal of what little breath
      he had in telling Anthea about a wonderful dream he had. &lsquo;You would hardly
      believe,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that anyone COULD have such a detailed vision.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anthea could believe it, she said, quite easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ceased to talk about thought-transference. He had now seen too many
      wonders to believe that.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of their breathless condition none of the children
      suggested any new excursions through the Amulet. Robert voiced the mood of
      the others when he said that they were &lsquo;fed up&rsquo; with Amulet for a bit.
      They undoubtedly were.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Psammead, it went to sand and stayed there, worn out by the
      terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to take in
      obedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned gentleman and the
      Babylonian queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children let it sleep. The danger of taking it about among strange
      people who might at any moment utter undesirable wishes was becoming more
      and more plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there are pleasant things to be done in London without any aid from
      Amulets or Psammeads. You can, for instance visit the Tower of London, the
      Houses of Parliament, the National Gallery, the Zoological Gardens, the
      various Parks, the Museums at South Kensington, Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s
      Exhibition of Waxworks, or the Botanical Gardens at Kew. You can go to Kew
      by river steamer&mdash;and this is the way that the children would have
      gone if they had gone at all. Only they never did, because it was when
      they were discussing the arrangements for the journey, and what they
      should take with them to eat and how much of it, and what the whole thing
      would cost, that the adventure of the Little Black Girl began to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were sitting on a seat in St James&rsquo;s Park. They had been
      watching the pelican repulsing with careful dignity the advances of the
      seagulls who are always so anxious to play games with it. The pelican
      thinks, very properly, that it hasn&rsquo;t the figure for games, so it spends
      most of its time pretending that that is not the reason why it won&rsquo;t play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breathlessness caused by Atlantis was wearing off a little. Cyril, who
      always wanted to understand all about everything, was turning things over
      in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not; I&rsquo;m only thinking,&rsquo; he answered when Robert asked him what he
      was so grumpy about. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when I&rsquo;ve thought it all out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s about the Amulet I don&rsquo;t want to hear it,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody asked you to,&rsquo; retorted Cyril mildly, &lsquo;and I haven&rsquo;t finished my
      inside thinking about it yet. Let&rsquo;s go to Kew in the meantime.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather go in a steamer,&rsquo; said Robert; and the girls laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;BE funny. I would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, he was, rather,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think, Squirrel, if it hurts you so,&rsquo; said Robert kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, shut up,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;or else talk about Kew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to see the palms there,&rsquo; said Anthea hastily, &lsquo;to see if they&rsquo;re
      anything like the ones on the island where we united the Cook and the
      Burglar by the Reverend Half-Curate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All disagreeableness was swept away in a pleasant tide of recollections,
      and &lsquo;Do you remember...?&rsquo; they said. &lsquo;Have you forgotten...?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My hat!&rsquo; remarked Cyril pensively, as the flood of reminiscence ebbed a
      little; &lsquo;we have had some times.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have that,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have any more,&rsquo; said Jane anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking about,&rsquo; Cyril replied; and just then they
      heard the Little Black Girl sniff. She was quite close to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not really a little black girl. She was shabby and not very clean,
      and she had been crying so much that you could hardly see, through the
      narrow chink between her swollen lids, how very blue her eyes were. It was
      her dress that was black, and it was too big and too long for her, and she
      wore a speckled black-ribboned sailor hat that would have fitted a much
      bigger head than her little flaxen one. And she stood looking at the
      children and sniffing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; said Anthea, jumping up. &lsquo;Whatever is the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand on the little girl&rsquo;s arm. It was rudely shaken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You leave me be,&rsquo; said the little girl. &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t doing nothing to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what is it?&rsquo; Anthea asked. &lsquo;Has someone been hurting you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rsquo; said the little girl fiercely. &lsquo;YOU&rsquo;RE all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come away,&rsquo; said Robert, pulling at Anthea&rsquo;s sleeve. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a nasty, rude
      little kid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s only dreadfully unhappy. What is it?&rsquo; she
      asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, YOU&rsquo;RE all right,&rsquo; the child repeated; &lsquo;YOU ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to the
      Union.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t we take you home?&rsquo; said Anthea; and Jane added, &lsquo;Where does your
      mother live?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She don&rsquo;t live nowheres&mdash;she&rsquo;s dead&mdash;so now!&rsquo; said the little
      girl fiercely, in tones of miserable triumph. Then she opened her swollen
      eyes widely, stamped her foot in fury, and ran away. She ran no further
      than to the next bench, flung herself down there and began to cry without
      even trying not to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea, quite at once, went to the little girl and put her arms as tight
      as she could round the hunched-up black figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cry so, dear, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she whispered under the brim of
      the large sailor hat, now very crooked indeed. &lsquo;Tell Anthea all about it;
      Anthea&rsquo;ll help you. There, there, dear, don&rsquo;t cry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The others stood at a distance. One or two passers-by stared curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was now only crying part of the time; the rest of the time she
      seemed to be talking to Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Anthea beckoned Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s horrible!&rsquo; she said in a furious whisper, &lsquo;her father was a
      carpenter and he was a steady man, and never touched a drop except on a
      Saturday, and he came up to London for work, and there wasn&rsquo;t any, and
      then he died; and her name is Imogen, and she&rsquo;s nine come next November.
      And now her mother&rsquo;s dead, and she&rsquo;s to stay tonight with Mrs Shrobsall&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      a landlady that&rsquo;s been kind&mdash;and tomorrow the Relieving Officer is
      coming for her, and she&rsquo;s going into the Union; that means the Workhouse.
      It&rsquo;s too terrible. What can we do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s ask the learned gentleman,&rsquo; said Jane brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as no one else could think of anything better the whole party walked
      back to Fitzroy Street as fast as it could, the little girl holding tight
      to Anthea&rsquo;s hand and now not crying any more, only sniffing gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman looked up from his writing with the smile that had
      grown much easier to him than it used to be. They were quite at home in
      his room now; it really seemed to welcome them. Even the mummy-case
      appeared to smile as if in its distant superior ancient Egyptian way it
      were rather pleased to see them than not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea sat on the stairs with Imogen, who was nine come next November,
      while the others went in and explained the difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman listened with grave attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It really does seem rather rough luck,&rsquo; Cyril concluded, &lsquo;because I&rsquo;ve
      often heard about rich people who wanted children most awfully&mdash;though
      I know <i>I</i> never should&mdash;but they do. There must be somebody
      who&rsquo;d be glad to have her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gipsies are awfully fond of children,&rsquo; Robert hopefully said. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re
      always stealing them. Perhaps they&rsquo;d have her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s quite a nice little girl really,&rsquo; Jane added; &lsquo;she was only rude at
      first because we looked jolly and happy, and she wasn&rsquo;t. You understand
      that, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he, absently fingering a little blue image from Egypt. &lsquo;I
      understand that very well. As you say, there must be some home where she
      would be welcome.&rsquo; He scowled thoughtfully at the little blue image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea outside thought the explanation was taking a very long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so busy trying to cheer and comfort the little black girl that she
      never noticed the Psammead who, roused from sleep by her voice, had shaken
      itself free of sand, and was coming crookedly up the stairs. It was close
      to her before she saw it. She picked it up and settled it in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked the black child. &lsquo;Is it a cat or a organ-monkey, or
      what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Anthea heard the learned gentleman say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I wish we could find a home where they would be glad to have her,&rsquo; 
      and instantly she felt the Psammead begin to blow itself out as it sat on
      her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up lifting the Psammead in her skirt, and holding Imogen by the
      hand, rushed into the learned gentleman&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least let&rsquo;s keep together,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;All hold hands&mdash;quick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle was like that formed for the Mulberry Bush or Ring-o&rsquo;-Roses.
      And Anthea was only able to take part in it by holding in her teeth the
      hem of her frock which, thus supported, formed a bag to hold the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it a game?&rsquo; asked the learned gentleman feebly. No one answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of suspense; then came that curious upside-down,
      inside-out sensation which one almost always feels when transported from
      one place to another by magic. Also there was that dizzy dimness of sight
      which comes on these occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist cleared, the upside-down, inside-out sensation subsided, and
      there stood the six in a ring, as before, only their twelve feet, instead
      of standing on the carpet of the learned gentleman&rsquo;s room, stood on green
      grass. Above them, instead of the dusky ceiling of the Fitzroy Street
      floor, was a pale blue sky. And where the walls had been and the painted
      mummy-case, were tall dark green trees, oaks and ashes, and in between the
      trees and under them tangled bushes and creeping ivy. There were
      beech-trees too, but there was nothing under them but their own dead red
      drifted leaves, and here and there a delicate green fern-frond.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there they stood in a circle still holding hands, as though they were
      playing Ring-o&rsquo;-Roses or the Mulberry Bush. Just six people hand in hand
      in a wood. That sounds simple, but then you must remember that they did
      not know WHERE the wood was, and what&rsquo;s more, they didn&rsquo;t know WHEN then
      wood was. There was a curious sort of feeling that made the learned
      gentleman say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another dream, dear me!&rsquo; and made the children almost certain that they
      were in a time a very long while ago. As for little Imogen, she said, &lsquo;Oh,
      my!&rsquo; and kept her mouth very much open indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we?&rsquo; Cyril asked the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Britain,&rsquo; said the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when?&rsquo; asked Anthea anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About the year fifty-five before the year you reckon time from,&rsquo; said the
      Psammead crossly. &lsquo;Is there anything else you want to know?&rsquo; it added,
      sticking its head out of the bag formed by Anthea&rsquo;s blue linen frock, and
      turning its snail&rsquo;s eyes to right and left. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been here before&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      very little changed.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, but why here?&rsquo; asked Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your inconsiderate friend,&rsquo; the Psammead replied, &lsquo;wished to find some
      home where they would be glad to have that unattractive and immature
      female human being whom you have picked up&mdash;gracious knows how. In
      Megatherium days properly brought-up children didn&rsquo;t talk to shabby
      strangers in parks. Your thoughtless friend wanted a place where someone
      would be glad to have this undesirable stranger. And now here you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see we are,&rsquo; said Anthea patiently, looking round on the tall gloom of
      the forest. &lsquo;But why HERE? Why NOW?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose anyone would want a child like that in YOUR times&mdash;in
      YOUR towns?&rsquo; said the Psammead in irritated tones. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got your
      country into such a mess that there&rsquo;s no room for half your children&mdash;and
      no one to want them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not our doing, you know,&rsquo; said Anthea gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And bringing me here without any waterproof or anything,&rsquo; said the
      Psammead still more crossly, &lsquo;when everyone knows how damp and foggy
      Ancient Britain was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, take my coat,&rsquo; said Robert, taking it off. Anthea spread the coat
      on the ground and, putting the Psammead on it, folded it round so that
      only the eyes and furry ears showed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; she said comfortingly. &lsquo;Now if it does begin to look like rain, I
      can cover you up in a minute. Now what are we to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The others who had stopped holding hands crowded round to hear the answer
      to this question. Imogen whispered in an awed tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t the organ monkey talk neither! I thought it was only parrots!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do?&rsquo; replied the Psammead. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you do!&rsquo; And it drew head
      and ears into the tweed covering of Robert&rsquo;s coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a dream,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman hopefully; &lsquo;something is
      sure to happen if we can prevent ourselves from waking up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And sure enough, something did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brooding silence of the dark forest was broken by the laughter of
      children and the sound of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a dream,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman to Jane, who hung back;
      &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t go with the tide of a dream&mdash;if you resist&mdash;you
      wake up, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sort of break in the undergrowth that was like a silly
      person&rsquo;s idea of a path. They went along this in Indian file, the learned
      gentleman leading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite soon they came to a large clearing in the forest. There were a
      number of houses&mdash;huts perhaps you would have called them&mdash;with
      a sort of mud and wood fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like the old Egyptian town,&rsquo; whispered Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was, rather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some children, with no clothes on at all, were playing what looked like
      Ring-o&rsquo;-Roses or Mulberry Bush. That is to say, they were dancing round in
      a ring, holding hands. On a grassy bank several women, dressed in blue and
      white robes and tunics of beast-skins sat watching the playing children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children from Fitzroy Street stood on the fringe of the forest looking
      at the games. One woman with long, fair braided hair sat a little apart
      from the others, and there was a look in her eyes as she followed the play
      of the children that made Anthea feel sad and sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None of those little girls is her own little girl,&rsquo; thought Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little black-clad London child pulled at Anthea&rsquo;s sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that one there&mdash;she&rsquo;s precious like mother;
      mother&rsquo;s &lsquo;air was somethink lovely, when she &lsquo;ad time to comb it out.
      Mother wouldn&rsquo;t never a-beat me if she&rsquo;d lived &lsquo;ere&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose
      there&rsquo;s e&rsquo;er a public nearer than Epping, do you, Miss?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In her eagerness the child had stepped out of the shelter of the forest.
      The sad-eyed woman saw her. She stood up, her thin face lighted up with a
      radiance like sunrise, her long, lean arms stretched towards the London
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Imogen!&rsquo; she cried&mdash;at least the word was more like that than any
      other word&mdash;&lsquo;Imogen!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of great silence; the naked children paused in their
      play, the women on the bank stared anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it IS mother&mdash;it IS!&rsquo; cried Imogen-from-London, and rushed
      across the cleared space. She and her mother clung together&mdash;so
      closely, so strongly that they stood an instant like a statue carved in
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the women crowded round. &lsquo;It IS my Imogen!&rsquo; cried the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh it is! And she wasn&rsquo;t eaten by wolves. She&rsquo;s come back to me. Tell me,
      my darling, how did you escape? Where have you been? Who has fed and
      clothed you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothink,&rsquo; said Imogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; whispered the women who crowded round, &lsquo;the terror of the
      wolves has turned her brain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you know ME?&rsquo; said the fair-haired woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Imogen, clinging with black-clothed arms to the bare neck, answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, mother, I know YOU right &lsquo;nough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it? What do they say?&rsquo; the learned gentleman asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wished to come where someone wanted the child,&rsquo; said the Psammead.
      &lsquo;The child says this is her mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can see,&rsquo; said the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But is she really? Her child, I mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who knows?&rsquo; said the Psammead; &lsquo;but each one fills the empty place in the
      other&rsquo;s heart. It is enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman, &lsquo;this is a good dream. I wish the child
      might stay in the dream.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead blew itself out and granted the wish. So Imogen&rsquo;s future was
      assured. She had found someone to want her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If only all the children that no one wants,&rsquo; began the learned gentleman&mdash;but
      the woman interrupted. She came towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Welcome, all!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I am the Queen, and my child tells me that you
      have befriended her; and this I well believe, looking on your faces. Your
      garb is strange, but faces I can read. The child is bewitched, I see that
      well, but in this she speaks truth. Is it not so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children said it wasn&rsquo;t worth mentioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you could have seen all the honours and kindnesses lavished on the
      children and the learned gentleman by those ancient Britons.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would have thought, to see them, that a child was something to make a
      fuss about, not a bit of rubbish to be hustled about the streets and
      hidden away in the Workhouse. It wasn&rsquo;t as grand as the entertainment at
      Babylon, but somehow it was more satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you children have some wonderful influence on me,&rsquo; said the
      learned gentleman. &lsquo;I never dreamed such dreams before I knew you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when they were alone that night under the stars where the Britons
      had spread a heap Of dried fern for them to sleep on, that Cyril spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve made it all right for Imogen, and had a jolly good
      time. I vote we get home again before the fighting begins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What fighting?&rsquo; asked Jane sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Julius Caesar, you little goat,&rsquo; replied her kind brother. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you see that if this is the year fifty-five, Julius Caesar may happen at
      any moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you liked Caesar,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I do&mdash;in the history. But that&rsquo;s different from being killed by
      his soldiers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we saw Caesar we might persuade him not to,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YOU persuade CAESAR,&rsquo; Robert laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman, before anyone could stop him, said, &lsquo;I only wish we
      could see Caesar some time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, in just the little time the Psammead took to blow itself
      out for wish-giving, the five, or six counting the Psammead, found
      themselves in Caesar&rsquo;s camp, just outside Caesar&rsquo;s tent. And they saw
      Caesar. The Psammead must have taken advantage of the loose wording of the
      learned gentleman&rsquo;s wish, for it was not the same time of day as that on
      which the wish had been uttered among the dried ferns. It was sunset, and
      the great man sat on a chair outside his tent gazing over the sea towards
      Britain&mdash;everyone knew without being told that it was towards
      Britain. Two golden eagles on the top of posts stood on each side of the
      tent, and on the flaps of the tent which was very gorgeous to look at were
      the letters S.P.Q.R.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man turned unchanged on the newcomers the august glance that he
      had turned on the violet waters of the Channel. Though they had suddenly
      appeared out of nothing, Caesar never showed by the faintest movement of
      an eyelid, by the least tightening of that firm mouth, that they were not
      some long expected embassy. He waved a calm hand towards the sentinels,
      who sprang weapons in hand towards the newcomers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Back!&rsquo; he said in a voice that thrilled like music. &lsquo;Since when has
      Caesar feared children and students?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To the children he seemed to speak in the only language they knew; but the
      learned gentleman heard&mdash;in rather a strange accent, but quite
      intelligibly&mdash;the lips of Caesar speaking in the Latin tongue, and in
      that tongue, a little stiffly, he answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a dream, O Caesar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A dream?&rsquo; repeated Caesar. &lsquo;What is a dream?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not it,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a sort of magic. We come out of another time
      and another place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we want to ask you not to trouble about conquering Britain,&rsquo; said
      Anthea; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a poor little place, not worth bothering about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you from Britain?&rsquo; the General asked. &lsquo;Your clothes are uncouth, but
      well woven, and your hair is short as the hair of Roman citizens, not long
      like the hair of barbarians, yet such I deem you to be.&rsquo; &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not,&rsquo; said
      Jane with angry eagerness; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re not barbarians at all. We come from the
      country where the sun never sets, and we&rsquo;ve read about you in books; and
      our country&rsquo;s full of fine things&mdash;St Paul&rsquo;s, and the Tower of
      London, and Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s Exhibition, and&mdash;&rsquo; Then the others
      stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rsquo; said Robert in a bitter undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caesar looked at the children a moment in silence. Then he called a
      soldier and spoke with him apart. Then he said aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You three elder children may go where you will within the camp. Few
      children are privileged to see the camp of Caesar. The student and the
      smaller girl-child will remain here with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody liked this; but when Caesar said a thing that thing was so, and
      there was an end to it. So the three went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone with Jane and the learned gentleman, the great Roman found it
      easy enough to turn them inside out. But it was not easy, even for him, to
      make head or tail of the insides of their minds when he had got at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman insisted that the whole thing was a dream, and
      refused to talk much, on the ground that if he did he would wake up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane, closely questioned, was full of information about railways, electric
      lights, balloons, men-of-war, cannons, and dynamite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do they fight with swords?&rsquo; asked the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, swords and guns and cannons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Caesar wanted to know what guns were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You fire them,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;and they go bang, and people fall down dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what are guns like?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane found them hard to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Robert has a toy one in his pocket,&rsquo; she said. So the others were
      recalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys explained the pistol to Caesar very fully, and he looked at it
      with the greatest interest. It was a two-shilling pistol, the one that had
      done such good service in the old Egyptian village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall cause guns to be made,&rsquo; said Caesar, &lsquo;and you will be detained
      till I know whether you have spoken the truth. I had just decided that
      Britain was not worth the bother of invading. But what you tell me decides
      me that it is very much worth while.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Britain is just a savage sort of
      island&mdash;all fogs and trees and big rivers. But the people are kind.
      We know a little girl there named Imogen. And it&rsquo;s no use your making guns
      because you can&rsquo;t fire them without gunpowder, and that won&rsquo;t be invented
      for hundreds of years, and we don&rsquo;t know how to make it, and we can&rsquo;t tell
      you. Do go straight home, dear Caesar, and let poor little Britain alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this other girl-child says&mdash;&rsquo; said Caesar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All Jane&rsquo;s been telling you is what it&rsquo;s going to be,&rsquo; Anthea
      interrupted, &lsquo;hundreds and hundreds of years from now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The little one is a prophetess, eh?&rsquo; said Caesar, with a whimsical look.
      &lsquo;Rather young for the business, isn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can call her a prophetess if you like,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;but what Anthea
      says is true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anthea?&rsquo; said Caesar. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a Greek name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; said Cyril, worriedly. &lsquo;I say, I do wish you&rsquo;d give up this
      idea of conquering Britain. It&rsquo;s not worth while, really it isn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary,&rsquo; said Caesar, &lsquo;what you&rsquo;ve told me has decided me to go,
      if it&rsquo;s only to find out what Britain is really like. Guards, detain these
      children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quick,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;before the guards begin detaining. We had enough of
      that in Babylon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane held up the Amulet away from the sunset, and said the word. The
      learned gentleman was pushed through and the others more quickly than ever
      before passed through the arch back into their own times and the quiet
      dusty sitting-room of the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a curious fact that when Caesar was encamped on the coast of Gaul&mdash;somewhere
      near Boulogne it was, I believe&mdash;he was sitting before his tent in
      the glow of the sunset, looking out over the violet waters of the English
      Channel. Suddenly he started, rubbed his eyes, and called his secretary.
      The young man came quickly from within the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marcus,&rsquo; said Caesar. &lsquo;I have dreamed a very wonderful dream. Some of it
      I forget, but I remember enough to decide what was not before determined.
      Tomorrow the ships that have been brought round from the Ligeris shall be
      provisioned. We shall sail for this three-cornered island. First, we will
      take but two legions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, if what we have heard be true, should suffice. But if my dream be
      true, then a hundred legions will not suffice. For the dream I dreamed was
      the most wonderful that ever tormented the brain even of Caesar. And
      Caesar has dreamed some strange things in his time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if you hadn&rsquo;t told Caesar all that about how things are now, he&rsquo;d
      never have invaded Britain,&rsquo; said Robert to Jane as they sat down to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nonsense,&rsquo; said Anthea, pouring out; &lsquo;it was all settled hundreds of
      years ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;Jam, please. This about time being only a
      thingummy of thought is very confusing. If everything happens at the same
      time&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It CAN&rsquo;T!&rsquo; said Anthea stoutly, &lsquo;the present&rsquo;s the present and the past&rsquo;s
      the past.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not always,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When we were in the Past the present was the future. Now then!&rsquo; he added
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Anthea could not deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have liked to see more of the camp,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, we didn&rsquo;t get much for our money&mdash;but Imogen is happy, that&rsquo;s
      one thing,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;We left her happy in the Past. I&rsquo;ve often seen
      about people being happy in the Past, in poetry books. I see what it means
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a bad idea,&rsquo; said the Psammead sleepily, putting its head out of
      its bag and taking it in again suddenly, &lsquo;being left in the Past.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone remembered this afterwards, when&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 11. BEFORE PHARAOH
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the day after the adventure of Julius Caesar and the Little Black
      Girl that Cyril, bursting into the bathroom to wash his hands for dinner
      (you have no idea how dirty they were, for he had been playing shipwrecked
      mariners all the morning on the leads at the back of the house, where the
      water-cistern is), found Anthea leaning her elbows on the edge of the
      bath, and crying steadily into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; he said, with brotherly concern, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s up now? Dinner&rsquo;ll be
      cold before you&rsquo;ve got enough salt-water for a bath.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go away,&rsquo; said Anthea fiercely. &lsquo;I hate you! I hate everybody!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stricken pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Cyril tamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody ever does know anything,&rsquo; sobbed Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were waxy. I thought you&rsquo;d just hurt your fingers with
      the tap again like you did last week,&rsquo; Cyril carefully explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;fingers!&rsquo; sneered Anthea through her sniffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, drop it, Panther,&rsquo; he said uncomfortably. &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t been having
      a row or anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Wash your horrid hands, for goodness&rsquo; sake, if that&rsquo;s
      what you came for, or go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea was so seldom cross that when she was cross the others were always
      more surprised than angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril edged along the side of the bath and stood beside her. He put his
      hand on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dry up, do,&rsquo; he said, rather tenderly for him. And, finding that though
      she did not at once take his advice she did not seem to resent it, he put
      his arm awkwardly across her shoulders and rubbed his head against her
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; he said, in the tone of one administering a priceless cure for
      all possible sorrows. &lsquo;Now, what&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Promise you won&rsquo;t laugh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel laughish myself,&rsquo; said Cyril, dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Anthea, leaning her ear against his head, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      Mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Mother?&rsquo; asked Cyril, with apparent want of
      sympathy. &lsquo;She was all right in her letter this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but I want her so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one,&rsquo; said Cyril briefly, and the brevity of his tone
      admitted a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;I know. We all want her all the time. But I want
      her now most dreadfully, awfully much. I never wanted anything so much.
      That Imogen child&mdash;the way the ancient British Queen cuddled her up!
      And Imogen wasn&rsquo;t me, and the Queen was Mother. And then her letter this
      morning! And about The Lamb liking the salt bathing! And she bathed him in
      this very bath the night before she went away&mdash;oh, oh, oh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril thumped her on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheer up,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You know my inside thinking that I was doing? Well,
      that was partly about Mother. We&rsquo;ll soon get her back. If you&rsquo;ll chuck it,
      like a sensible kid, and wash your face, I&rsquo;ll tell you about it. That&rsquo;s
      right. You let me get to the tap. Can&rsquo;t you stop crying? Shall I put the
      door-key down your back?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for noses,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m not a kid any more than you
      are,&rsquo; but she laughed a little, and her mouth began to get back into its
      proper shape. You know what an odd shape your mouth gets into when you cry
      in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said Cyril, working the soap round and round between his
      hands in a thick slime of grey soapsuds. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking. We&rsquo;ve only
      just PLAYED with the Amulet so far. We&rsquo;ve got to work it now&mdash;WORK it
      for all it&rsquo;s worth. And it isn&rsquo;t only Mother either. There&rsquo;s Father out
      there all among the fighting. I don&rsquo;t howl about it, but I THINK&mdash;Oh,
      bother the soap!&rsquo; The grey-lined soap had squirted out under the pressure
      of his fingers, and had hit Anthea&rsquo;s chin with as much force as though it
      had been shot from a catapult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There now,&rsquo; she said regretfully, &lsquo;now I shall have to wash my face.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d have had to do that anyway,&rsquo; said Cyril with conviction. &lsquo;Now, my
      idea&rsquo;s this. You know missionaries?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anthea, who did not know a single one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, they always take the savages beads and brandy, and stays, and hats,
      and braces, and really useful things&mdash;things the savages haven&rsquo;t got,
      and never heard about. And the savages love them for their kind
      generousness, and give them pearls, and shells, and ivory, and
      cassowaries. And that&rsquo;s the way&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a sec,&rsquo; said Anthea, splashing. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t hear what you&rsquo;re saying.
      Shells and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shells, and things like that. The great thing is to get people to love
      you by being generous. And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to do. Next time we go
      into the Past we&rsquo;ll regularly fit out the expedition. You remember how the
      Babylonian Queen froze on to that pocket-book? Well, we&rsquo;ll take things
      like that. And offer them in exchange for a sight of the Amulet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sight of it is not much good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, silly. But, don&rsquo;t you see, when we&rsquo;ve seen it we shall know where it
      is, and we can go and take it in the night when everybody is asleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be stealing, would it?&rsquo; said Anthea thoughtfully, &lsquo;because it
      will be such an awfully long time ago when we do it. Oh, there&rsquo;s that bell
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as dinner was eaten (it was tinned salmon and lettuce, and a jam
      tart), and the cloth cleared away, the idea was explained to the others,
      and the Psammead was aroused from sand, and asked what it thought would be
      good merchandise with which to buy the affection of say, the Ancient
      Egyptians, and whether it thought the Amulet was likely to be found in the
      Court of Pharaoh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it shook its head, and shot out its snail&rsquo;s eyes hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not allowed to play in this game,&rsquo; it said. &lsquo;Of course I COULD find
      out in a minute where the thing was, only I mayn&rsquo;t. But I may go so far as
      to own that your idea of taking things with you isn&rsquo;t a bad one. And I
      shouldn&rsquo;t show them all at once. Take small things and conceal them
      craftily about your persons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This advice seemed good. Soon the table was littered over with things
      which the children thought likely to interest the Ancient Egyptians.
      Anthea brought dolls, puzzle blocks, a wooden tea-service, a green leather
      case with Necessaire written on it in gold letters. Aunt Emma had once
      given it to Anthea, and it had then contained scissors, penknife, bodkin,
      stiletto, thimble, corkscrew, and glove-buttoner. The scissors, knife, and
      thimble, and penknife were, of course, lost, but the other things were
      there and as good as new. Cyril contributed lead soldiers, a cannon, a
      catapult, a tin-opener, a tie-clip, and a tennis ball, and a padlock&mdash;no
      key. Robert collected a candle (&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose they ever saw a
      self-fitting paraffin one,&rsquo; he said), a penny Japanese pin-tray, a rubber
      stamp with his father&rsquo;s name and address on it, and a piece of putty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane added a key-ring, the brass handle of a poker, a pot that had held
      cold-cream, a smoked pearl button off her winter coat, and a key&mdash;no
      lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t take all this rubbish,&rsquo; said Robert, with some scorn. &lsquo;We must
      just each choose one thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon passed very agreeably in the attempt to choose from the
      table the four most suitable objects. But the four children could not
      agree what was suitable, and at last Cyril said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, let&rsquo;s each be blindfolded and reach out, and the first thing
      you touch you stick to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril touched the padlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea got the Necessaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert clutched the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane picked up the tie-clip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not much,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Ancient Egyptians wore ties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;I believe it&rsquo;s luckier not to really choose.
      In the stories it&rsquo;s always the thing the wood-cutter&rsquo;s son picks up in the
      forest, and almost throws away because he thinks it&rsquo;s no good, that turns
      out to be the magic thing in the end; or else someone&rsquo;s lost it, and he is
      rewarded with the hand of the King&rsquo;s daughter in marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want any hands in marriage, thank you.&rsquo; said Cyril firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor yet me,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s always the end of the adventures when it
      comes to the marriage hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;ARE we ready?&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It IS Egypt we&rsquo;re going to, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;nice Egypt?&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;I
      won&rsquo;t go anywhere I don&rsquo;t know about&mdash;like that dreadful big-wavy
      burning-mountain city,&rsquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Psammead was coaxed into its bag. &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Cyril suddenly,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m rather sick of kings. And people notice you so in palaces. Besides
      the Amulet&rsquo;s sure to be in a Temple. Let&rsquo;s just go among the common
      people, and try to work ourselves up by degrees. We might get taken on as
      Temple assistants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like beadles,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;or vergers. They must have splendid chances
      of stealing the Temple treasures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Righto!&rsquo; was the general rejoinder. The charm was held up. It grew big
      once again, and once again the warm golden Eastern light glowed softly
      beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the children stepped through it loud and furious voices rang in their
      ears. They went suddenly from the quiet of Fitzroy Street dining-room into
      a very angry Eastern crowd, a crowd much too angry to notice them. They
      edged through it to the wall of a house and stood there. The crowd was of
      men, women, and children. They were of all sorts of complexions, and
      pictures of them might have been coloured by any child with a shilling
      paint-box. The colours that child would have used for complexions would
      have been yellow ochre, red ochre, light red, sepia, and indian ink. But
      their faces were painted already&mdash;black eyebrows and lashes, and some
      red lips. The women wore a sort of pinafore with shoulder straps, and
      loose things wound round their heads and shoulders. The men wore very
      little clothing&mdash;for they were the working people&mdash;and the
      Egyptian boys and girls wore nothing at all, unless you count the little
      ornaments hung on chains round their necks and waists. The children saw
      all this before they could hear anything distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was shouting so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a voice sounded above the other voices, and presently it was speaking
      in a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Comrades and fellow workers,&rsquo; it said, and it was the voice of a tall,
      coppery-coloured man who had climbed into a chariot that had been stopped
      by the crowd. Its owner had bolted, muttering something about calling the
      Guards, and now the man spoke from it. &lsquo;Comrades and fellow workers, how
      long are we to endure the tyranny of our masters, who live in idleness and
      luxury on the fruit of our toil? They only give us a bare subsistence
      wage, and they live on the fat of the land. We labour all our lives to
      keep them in wanton luxury. Let us make an end of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar of applause answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you going to do it?&rsquo; cried a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look out,&rsquo; cried another, &lsquo;or you&rsquo;ll get yourself into trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard almost every single word of that,&rsquo; whispered Robert, &lsquo;in Hyde
      Park last Sunday!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us strike for more bread and onions and beer, and a longer mid-day
      rest,&rsquo; the speaker went on. &lsquo;You are tired, you are hungry, you are
      thirsty. You are poor, your wives and children are pining for food. The
      barns of the rich are full to bursting with the corn we want, the corn our
      labour has grown. To the granaries!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the granaries!&rsquo; cried half the crowd; but another voice shouted clear
      above the tumult, &lsquo;To Pharaoh! To the King! Let&rsquo;s present a petition to
      the King! He will listen to the voice of the oppressed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the crowd swayed one way and another&mdash;first towards the
      granaries and then towards the palace. Then, with a rush like that of an
      imprisoned torrent suddenly set free, it surged along the street towards
      the palace, and the children were carried with it. Anthea found it
      difficult to keep the Psammead from being squeezed very uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd swept through the streets of dull-looking houses with few
      windows, very high up, across the market where people were not buying but
      exchanging goods. In a momentary pause Robert saw a basket of onions
      exchanged for a hair comb and five fish for a string of beads. The people
      in the market seemed better off than those in the crowd; they had finer
      clothes, and more of them. They were the kind of people who, nowadays,
      would have lived at Brixton or Brockley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble now?&rsquo; a languid, large-eyed lady in a crimped,
      half-transparent linen dress, with her black hair very much braided and
      puffed out, asked of a date-seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the working-men&mdash;discontented as usual,&rsquo; the man answered.
      &lsquo;Listen to them. Anyone would think it mattered whether they had a little
      more or less to eat. Dregs of society!&rsquo; said the date-seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scum!&rsquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve heard THAT before, too,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the voice of the crowd changed, from anger to doubt, from
      doubt to fear. There were other voices shouting; they shouted defiance and
      menace, and they came nearer very quickly. There was the rattle of wheels
      and the pounding of hoofs. A voice shouted, &lsquo;Guards!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Guards! The Guards!&rsquo; shouted another voice, and the crowd of workmen
      took up the cry. &lsquo;The Guards! Pharaoh&rsquo;s Guards!&rsquo; And swaying a little once
      more, the crowd hung for a moment as it were balanced. Then as the
      trampling hoofs came nearer the workmen fled dispersed, up alleys and into
      the courts of houses, and the Guards in their embossed leather chariots
      swept down the street at the gallop, their wheels clattering over the
      stones, and their dark-coloured, blue tunics blown open and back with the
      wind of their going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So THAT riot&rsquo;s over,&rsquo; said the crimped-linen-dressed lady; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a
      blessing! And did you notice the Captain of the Guard? What a very
      handsome man he was, to be sure!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The four children had taken advantage of the moment&rsquo;s pause before the
      crowd turned to fly, to edge themselves and drag each other into an arched
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they each drew a long breath and looked at the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re well out of THAT,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;but I do wish the poor men hadn&rsquo;t been driven back
      before they could get to the King. He might have done something for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if he was the one in the Bible he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;He had a
      hard heart.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, that was the Moses one,&rsquo; Anthea explained. &lsquo;The Joseph
      one was quite different. I should like to see Pharaoh&rsquo;s house. I wonder
      whether it&rsquo;s like the Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought we decided to try to get taken on in a Temple,&rsquo; said Cyril in
      injured tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but we&rsquo;ve got to know someone first. Couldn&rsquo;t we make friends with a
      Temple doorkeeper&mdash;we might give him the padlock or something. I
      wonder which are temples and which are palaces,&rsquo; Robert added, glancing
      across the market-place to where an enormous gateway with huge side
      buildings towered towards the sky. To right and left of it were other
      buildings only a little less magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you wish to seek out the Temple of Amen Ra?&rsquo; asked a soft voice
      behind them, &lsquo;or the Temple of Mut, or the Temple of Khonsu?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned to find beside them a young man. He was shaved clean from head
      to foot, and on his feet were light papyrus sandals. He was clothed in a
      linen tunic of white, embroidered heavily in colours. He was gay with
      anklets, bracelets, and armlets of gold, richly inlaid. He wore a ring on
      his finger, and he had a short jacket of gold embroidery something like
      the Zouave soldiers wear, and on his neck was a gold collar with many
      amulets hanging from it. But among the amulets the children could see none
      like theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter which Temple,&rsquo; said Cyril frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me your mission,&rsquo; said the young man. &lsquo;I am a divine father of the
      Temple of Amen Ra and perhaps I can help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve come from the great Empire on which the sun
      never sets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought somehow that you&rsquo;d come from some odd, out-of-the-way spot,&rsquo; 
      said the priest with courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we&rsquo;ve seen a good many palaces. We thought we should like to see a
      Temple, for a change,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead stirred uneasily in its embroidered bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you brought gifts to the Temple?&rsquo; asked the priest cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We HAVE got some gifts,&rsquo; said Cyril with equal caution. &lsquo;You see there&rsquo;s
      magic mixed up in it. So we can&rsquo;t tell you everything. But we don&rsquo;t want
      to give our gifts for nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beware how you insult the god,&rsquo; said the priest sternly. &lsquo;I also can do
      magic. I can make a waxen image of you, and I can say words which, as the
      wax image melts before the fire, will make you dwindle away and at last
      perish miserably.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; said Cyril stoutly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s nothing. <i>I</i> can make FIRE
      itself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should jolly well like to see you do it,&rsquo; said the priest
      unbelievingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you shall,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;nothing easier. Just stand close round
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you need no preparation&mdash;no fasting, no incantations?&rsquo; The
      priest&rsquo;s tone was incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The incantation&rsquo;s quite short,&rsquo; said Cyril, taking the hint; &lsquo;and as for
      fasting, it&rsquo;s not needed in MY sort of magic. Union Jack, Printing Press,
      Gunpowder, Rule Britannia! Come, Fire, at the end of this little stick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had pulled a match from his pocket, and as he ended the incantation
      which contained no words that it seemed likely the Egyptian had ever heard
      he stooped in the little crowd of his relations and the priest and struck
      the match on his boot. He stood up, shielding the flame with one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See?&rsquo; he said, with modest pride. &lsquo;Here, take it into your hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; said the priest, swiftly backing. &lsquo;Can you do that
      again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come with me to the great double house of Pharaoh. He loves good
      magic, and he will raise you to honour and glory. There&rsquo;s no need of
      secrets between initiates,&rsquo; he went on confidentially. &lsquo;The fact is, I am
      out of favour at present owing to a little matter of failure of prophecy.
      I told him a beautiful princess would be sent to him from Syria, and, lo!
      a woman thirty years old arrived. But she WAS a beautiful woman not so
      long ago. Time is only a mode of thought, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children thrilled to the familiar words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you know that too, do you?&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is part of the mystery of all magic, is it not?&rsquo; said the priest. &lsquo;Now
      if I bring you to Pharaoh the little unpleasantness I spoke of will be
      forgotten. And I will ask Pharaoh, the Great House, Son of the Sun, and
      Lord of the South and North, to decree that you shall lodge in the Temple.
      Then you can have a good look round, and teach me your magic. And I will
      teach you mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea seemed good&mdash;at least it was better than any other which at
      that moment occurred to anybody, so they followed the priest through the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were very narrow and dirty. The best houses, the priest
      explained, were built within walls twenty to twenty-five feet high, and
      such windows as showed in the walls were very high up. The tops of
      palm-trees showed above the walls. The poor people&rsquo;s houses were little
      square huts with a door and two windows, and smoke coming out of a hole in
      the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The poor Egyptians haven&rsquo;t improved so very much in their building since
      the first time we came to Egypt,&rsquo; whispered Cyril to Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huts were roofed with palm branches, and everywhere there were
      chickens, and goats, and little naked children kicking about in the yellow
      dust. On one roof was a goat, who had climbed up and was eating the dry
      palm-leaves with snorts and head-tossings of delight. Over every house
      door was some sort of figure or shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amulets,&rsquo; the priest explained, &lsquo;to keep off the evil eye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of your &ldquo;nice Egypt&rdquo;,&rsquo; Robert whispered to Jane; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      simply not a patch on Babylon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you wait till you see the palace,&rsquo; Jane whispered back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The palace was indeed much more magnificent than anything they had yet
      seen that day, though it would have made but a poor show beside that of
      the Babylonian King. They came to it through a great square pillared
      doorway of sandstone that stood in a high brick wall. The shut doors were
      of massive cedar, with bronze hinges, and were studded with bronze nails.
      At the side was a little door and a wicket gate, and through this the
      priest led the children. He seemed to know a word that made the sentries
      make way for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside was a garden, planted with hundreds of different kinds of trees and
      flowering shrubs, a lake full of fish, with blue lotus flowers at the
      margin, and ducks swimming about cheerfully, and looking, as Jane said,
      quite modern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The guard-chamber, the store-houses, the queen&rsquo;s house,&rsquo; said the priest,
      pointing them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed through open courtyards, paved with flat stones, and the
      priest whispered to a guard at a great inner gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are fortunate,&rsquo; he said to the children, &lsquo;Pharaoh is even now in the
      Court of Honour. Now, don&rsquo;t forget to be overcome with respect and
      admiration. It won&rsquo;t do any harm if you fall flat on your faces. And
      whatever you do, don&rsquo;t speak until you&rsquo;re spoken to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There used to be that rule in our country,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;when my father
      was a little boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outer end of the great hall a crowd of people were arguing with and
      even shoving the Guards, who seemed to make it a rule not to let anyone
      through unless they were bribed to do it. The children heard several
      promises of the utmost richness, and wondered whether they would ever be
      kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      All round the hall were pillars of painted wood. The roof was of cedar,
      gorgeously inlaid. About half-way up the hall was a wide, shallow step
      that went right across the hall; then a little farther on another; and
      then a steep flight of narrower steps, leading right up to the throne on
      which Pharaoh sat. He sat there very splendid, his red and white double
      crown on his head, and his sceptre in his hand. The throne had a canopy of
      wood and wooden pillars painted in bright colours. On a low, broad bench
      that ran all round the hall sat the friends, relatives, and courtiers of
      the King, leaning on richly-covered cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest led the children up the steps till they all stood before the
      throne; and then, suddenly, he fell on his face with hands outstretched.
      The others did the same, Anthea falling very carefully because of the
      Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Raise them,&rsquo; said the voice of Pharaoh, &lsquo;that they may speak to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers of the King&rsquo;s household raised them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are these strangers?&rsquo; Pharaoh asked, and added very crossly, &lsquo;And
      what do you mean, Rekh-mara, by daring to come into my presence while your
      innocence is not established?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, great King,&rsquo; said the young priest, &lsquo;you are the very image of Ra,
      and the likeness of his son Horus in every respect. You know the thoughts
      of the hearts of the gods and of men, and you have divined that these
      strangers are the children of the children of the vile and conquered Kings
      of the Empire where the sun never sets. They know a magic not known to the
      Egyptians. And they come with gifts in their hands as tribute to Pharaoh,
      in whose heart is the wisdom of the gods, and on his lips their truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is all very well,&rsquo; said Pharaoh, &lsquo;but where are the gifts?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children, bowing as well as they could in their embarrassment at
      finding themselves the centre of interest in a circle more grand, more
      golden and more highly coloured than they could have imagined possible,
      pulled out the padlock, the Necessaire, and the tie-clip. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s not
      tribute all the same,&rsquo; Cyril muttered. &lsquo;England doesn&rsquo;t pay tribute!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pharaoh examined all the things with great interest when the chief of the
      household had taken them up to him. &lsquo;Deliver them to the Keeper of the
      Treasury,&rsquo; he said to one near him. And to the children he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A small tribute, truly, but strange, and not without worth. And the
      magic, O Rekh-mara?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These unworthy sons of a conquered nation...&rsquo; began Rekh-mara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the kind!&rsquo; Cyril whispered angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... of a vile and conquered nation, can make fire to spring from dry wood&mdash;in
      the sight of all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should jolly well like to see them do it,&rsquo; said Pharaoh, just as the
      priest had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Cyril, without more ado, did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do more magic,&rsquo; said the King, with simple appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He cannot do any more magic,&rsquo; said Anthea suddenly, and all eyes were
      turned on her, &lsquo;because of the voice of the free people who are shouting
      for bread and onions and beer and a long mid-day rest. If the people had
      what they wanted, he could do more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A rude-spoken girl,&rsquo; said Pharaoh. &lsquo;But give the dogs what they want,&rsquo; he
      said, without turning his head. &lsquo;Let them have their rest and their extra
      rations. There are plenty of slaves to work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A richly-dressed official hurried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be the idol of the people,&rsquo; Rekh-mara whispered joyously; &lsquo;the
      Temple of Amen will not contain their offerings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril struck another match, and all the court was overwhelmed with delight
      and wonder. And when Cyril took the candle from his pocket and lighted it
      with the match, and then held the burning candle up before the King the
      enthusiasm knew no bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, greatest of all, before whom sun and moon and stars bow down,&rsquo; said
      Rekh-mara insinuatingly, &lsquo;am I pardoned? Is my innocence made plain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As plain as it ever will be, I daresay,&rsquo; said Pharaoh shortly. &lsquo;Get along
      with you. You are pardoned. Go in peace.&rsquo; The priest went with lightning
      swiftness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said the King suddenly, &lsquo;is it that moves in that sack?
    </p>
    <p>
      Show me, oh strangers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it but to show the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seize it,&rsquo; said Pharaoh carelessly. &lsquo;A very curious monkey. It will be a
      nice little novelty for my wild beast collection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And instantly, the entreaties of the children availing as little as the
      bites of the Psammead, though both bites and entreaties were fervent, it
      was carried away from before their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, DO be careful!&rsquo; cried Anthea. &lsquo;At least keep it dry! Keep it in its
      sacred house!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up the embroidered bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a magic creature,&rsquo; cried Robert; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s simply priceless!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to take it away,&rsquo; cried Jane incautiously. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a shame,
      a barefaced robbery, that&rsquo;s what it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an awful silence. Then Pharaoh spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take the sacred house of the beast from them,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and imprison
      all. Tonight after supper it may be our pleasure to see more magic. Guard
      them well, and do not torture them&mdash;yet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; sobbed Jane, as they were led away. &lsquo;I knew exactly what it
      would be! Oh, I wish you hadn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shut up, silly,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;You know you WOULD come to Egypt. It was
      your own idea entirely. Shut up. It&rsquo;ll be all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought we should play ball with queens,&rsquo; sobbed Jane, &lsquo;and have no end
      of larks! And now everything&rsquo;s going to be perfectly horrid!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The room they were shut up in WAS a room, and not a dungeon, as the elder
      ones had feared. That, as Anthea said, was one comfort. There were
      paintings on the wall that at any other time would have been most
      interesting. And a sort of low couch, and chairs. When they were alone
      Jane breathed a sigh of relief. &lsquo;Now we can get home all right,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And leave the Psammead?&rsquo; said Anthea reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a sec. I&rsquo;ve got an idea,&rsquo; said Cyril. He pondered for a few moments.
      Then he began hammering on the heavy cedar door. It opened, and a guard
      put in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop that row,&rsquo; he said sternly, &lsquo;or&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; Cyril interrupted, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s very dull for you isn&rsquo;t it? Just
      doing nothing but guard us. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see some magic? We&rsquo;re not
      too proud to do it for you. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rsquo; said the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, you get us that monkey of ours that was taken away, and we&rsquo;ll
      show you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do I know you&rsquo;re not making game of me?&rsquo; asked the soldier.
      &lsquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you only wanted to get the creature so as to set it
      on me. I daresay its teeth and claws are poisonous.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, look here,&rsquo; 
      said Robert. &lsquo;You see we&rsquo;ve got nothing with us? You just shut the door,
      and open it again in five minutes, and we&rsquo;ll have got a magic&mdash;oh, I
      don&rsquo;t know&mdash;a magic flower in a pot for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you can do that you can do anything,&rsquo; said the soldier, and he went
      out and barred the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of course, they held up the Amulet. They found the East by holding
      it up, and turning slowly till the Amulet began to grow big, walked home
      through it, and came back with a geranium in full scarlet flower from the
      staircase window of the Fitzroy Street house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said the soldier when he came in. &lsquo;I really am&mdash;!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can do much more wonderful things than that&mdash;oh, ever so much,&rsquo; 
      said Anthea persuasively, &lsquo;if we only have our monkey. And here&rsquo;s twopence
      for yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier looked at the twopence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert explained how much simpler it was to pay money for things than to
      exchange them as the people were doing in the market. Later on the soldier
      gave the coins to his captain, who, later still, showed them to Pharaoh,
      who of course kept them and was much struck with the idea. That was really
      how coins first came to be used in Egypt. You will not believe this, I
      daresay, but really, if you believe the rest of the story, I don&rsquo;t see why
      you shouldn&rsquo;t believe this as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Anthea, struck by a sudden thought, &lsquo;I suppose it&rsquo;ll be all
      right about those workmen? The King won&rsquo;t go back on what he said about
      them just because he&rsquo;s angry with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said the soldier, &lsquo;you see, he&rsquo;s rather afraid of magic. He&rsquo;ll
      keep to his word right enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then THAT&rsquo;S all right,&rsquo; said Robert; and Anthea said softly and coaxingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, DO get us the monkey, and then you&rsquo;ll see some lovely magic. Do&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      a nice, kind soldier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;ve put your precious monkey, but if I can get
      another chap to take on my duty here I&rsquo;ll see what I can do,&rsquo; he said
      grudgingly, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;that we&rsquo;re going off without even TRYING for
      the other half of the Amulet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really think we&rsquo;d better,&rsquo; said Anthea tremulously. &lsquo;Of course the
      other half of the Amulet&rsquo;s here somewhere or our half wouldn&rsquo;t have
      brought us here. I do wish we could find it. It is a pity we don&rsquo;t know
      any REAL magic. Then we could find out. I do wonder where it is&mdash;exactly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had only known it, something very like the other half of the
      Amulet was very near them. It hung round the neck of someone, and that
      someone was watching them through a chink, high up in the wall, specially
      devised for watching people who were imprisoned. But they did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nearly an hour of anxious waiting. They tried to take an
      interest in the picture on the wall, a picture of harpers playing very odd
      harps and women dancing at a feast. They examined the painted plaster
      floor, and the chairs were of white painted wood with coloured stripes at
      intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the time went slowly, and everyone had time to think of how Pharaoh
      had said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t torture them&mdash;YET.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the worst comes to the worst,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;we must just bunk, and
      leave the Psammead. I believe it can take care of itself well enough. They
      won&rsquo;t kill it or hurt it when they find it can speak and give wishes.
      They&rsquo;ll build it a temple, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bear to go without it,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;and Pharaoh said &ldquo;After
      supper&rdquo;, that won&rsquo;t be just yet. And the soldier WAS curious. I&rsquo;m sure
      we&rsquo;re all right for the present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same, the sounds of the door being unbarred seemed one of the
      prettiest sounds possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose he hasn&rsquo;t got the Psammead?&rsquo; whispered Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that doubt was set at rest by the Psammead itself; for almost before
      the door was open it sprang through the chink of it into Anthea&rsquo;s arms,
      shivering and hunching up its fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s its fancy overcoat,&rsquo; said the soldier, holding out the bag, into
      which the Psammead immediately crept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;what would you like us to do? Anything you&rsquo;d like us
      to get for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any little trick you like,&rsquo; said the soldier. &lsquo;If you can get a strange
      flower blooming in an earthenware vase you can get anything, I suppose,&rsquo; 
      he said. &lsquo;I just wish I&rsquo;d got two men&rsquo;s loads of jewels from the King&rsquo;s
      treasury. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always wished for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word &lsquo;WISH&rsquo; the children knew that the Psammead would attend to
      THAT bit of magic. It did, and the floor was littered with a spreading
      heap of gold and precious stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any other little trick?&rsquo; asked Cyril loftily. &lsquo;Shall we become invisible?
      Vanish?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, if you like,&rsquo; said the soldier; &lsquo;but not through the door, you
      don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed it carefully and set his broad Egyptian back against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! no!&rsquo; cried a voice high up among the tops of the tall wooden pillars
      that stood against the wall. There was a sound of someone moving above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier was as much surprised as anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s magic, if you like,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Jane held up the Amulet, uttering the word of Power. At the sound
      of it and at the sight of the Amulet growing into the great arch the
      soldier fell flat on his face among the jewels with a cry of awe and
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children went through the arch with a quickness born of long practice.
      But Jane stayed in the middle of the arch and looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others, standing on the dining-room carpet in Fitzroy Street, turned
      and saw her still in the arch. &lsquo;Someone&rsquo;s holding her,&rsquo; cried Cyril. &lsquo;We
      must go back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But they pulled at Jane&rsquo;s hands just to see if she would come, and, of
      course, she did come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as usual, the arch was little again and there they all were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I do wish you hadn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; Jane said crossly. &lsquo;It WAS so interesting. The
      priest had come in and he was kicking the soldier, and telling him he&rsquo;d
      done it now, and they must take the jewels and flee for their lives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And did they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You interfered,&rsquo; said Jane ungratefully. &lsquo;I SHOULD have
      liked to see the last of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, none of them had seen the last of it&mdash;if by &lsquo;it&rsquo; 
      Jane meant the adventure of the Priest and the Soldier.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 12. THE SORRY-PRESENT AND THE EXPELLED LITTLE BOY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, said Cyril, sitting on the dining-table and swinging his legs;
      &lsquo;I really have got it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Got what?&rsquo; was the not unnatural rejoinder of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril was making a boat with a penknife and a piece of wood, and the girls
      were making warm frocks for their dolls, for the weather was growing
      chilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see? It&rsquo;s really not any good our going into the Past
      looking for that Amulet. The Past&rsquo;s as full of different times as&mdash;as
      the sea is of sand. We&rsquo;re simply bound to hit upon the wrong time. We
      might spend our lives looking for the Amulet and never see a sight of it.
      Why, it&rsquo;s the end of September already. It&rsquo;s like looking for a needle in&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bottle of hay&mdash;I know,&rsquo; interrupted Robert; &lsquo;but if we don&rsquo;t go on
      doing that, what ARE we to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rsquo; said Cyril in mysterious accents. &lsquo;Oh, BOTHER!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Nurse had come in with the tray of knives, forks, and glasses, and was
      getting the tablecloth and table-napkins out of the chiffonier drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s always meal-times just when you come to anything interesting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a nice interesting handful YOU&rsquo;D be, Master Cyril,&rsquo; said old Nurse,
      &lsquo;if I wasn&rsquo;t to bring your meals up to time. Don&rsquo;t you begin grumbling
      now, fear you get something to grumble AT.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t grumbling,&rsquo; said Cyril quite untruly; &lsquo;but it does always happen
      like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You deserve to HAVE something happen,&rsquo; said old Nurse. &lsquo;Slave, slave,
      slave for you day and night, and never a word of thanks. ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you do everything beautifully,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the first time any of you&rsquo;s troubled to say so, anyhow,&rsquo; said Nurse
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of SAYING?&rsquo; inquired Robert. &lsquo;We EAT our meals fast
      enough, and almost always two helps. THAT ought to show you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said old Nurse, going round the table and putting the knives and
      forks in their places; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a man all over, Master Robert. There was my
      poor Green, all the years he lived with me I never could get more out of
      him than &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; when I asked him if he&rsquo;d fancied his dinner.
      And yet, when he lay a-dying, his last words to me was, &ldquo;Maria, you was
      always a good cook!&rdquo;&rsquo; She ended with a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so you are,&rsquo; cried Anthea, and she and Jane instantly hugged her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone out of the room Anthea said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know exactly how she feels. Now, look here! Let&rsquo;s do a penance to show
      we&rsquo;re sorry we didn&rsquo;t think about telling her before what nice cooking she
      does, and what a dear she is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Penances are silly,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if the penance is something to please someone else. I didn&rsquo;t mean old
      peas and hair shirts and sleeping on the stones. I mean we&rsquo;ll make her a
      sorry-present,&rsquo; explained Anthea. &lsquo;Look here! I vote Cyril doesn&rsquo;t tell us
      his idea until we&rsquo;ve done something for old Nurse. It&rsquo;s worse for us than
      him,&rsquo; she added hastily, &lsquo;because he knows what it is and we don&rsquo;t. Do you
      all agree?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The others would have been ashamed not to agree, so they did. It was not
      till quite near the end of dinner&mdash;mutton fritters and blackberry and
      apple pie&mdash;that out of the earnest talk of the four came an idea that
      pleased everybody and would, they hoped, please Nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril and Robert went out with the taste of apple still in their mouths
      and the purple of blackberries on their lips&mdash;and, in the case of
      Robert, on the wristband as well&mdash;and bought a big sheet of cardboard
      at the stationers. Then at the plumber&rsquo;s shop, that has tubes and pipes
      and taps and gas-fittings in the window, they bought a pane of glass the
      same size as the cardboard. The man cut it with a very interesting tool
      that had a bit of diamond at the end, and he gave them, out of his own
      free generousness, a large piece of putty and a small piece of glue.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were out the girls had floated four photographs of the four
      children off their cards in hot water. These were now stuck in a row along
      the top of the cardboard. Cyril put the glue to melt in a jampot, and put
      the jampot in a saucepan and saucepan on the fire, while Robert painted a
      wreath of poppies round the photographs. He painted rather well and very
      quickly, and poppies are easy to do if you&rsquo;ve once been shown how. Then
      Anthea drew some printed letters and Jane coloured them. The words were:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;With all our loves to shew
   We like the thigs to eat.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And when the painting was dry they all signed their names at the bottom
      and put the glass on, and glued brown paper round the edge and over the
      back, and put two loops of tape to hang it up by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course everyone saw when too late that there were not enough letters in
      &lsquo;things&rsquo;, so the missing &lsquo;n&rsquo; was put in. It was impossible, of course, to
      do the whole thing over again for just one letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Anthea, placing it carefully, face up, under the sofa.
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be hours before the glue&rsquo;s dry. Now, Squirrel, fire ahead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Cyril in a great hurry, rubbing at his gluey hands with
      his pocket handkerchief. &lsquo;What I mean to say is this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Robert at last, &lsquo;WHAT is it that you mean to say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rsquo; said Cyril, and again stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like WHAT?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I tell you if you will all keep on interrupting?&rsquo; said Cyril
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      So no one said any more, and with wrinkled frowns he arranged his ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;what I really mean is&mdash;we can remember now
      what we did when we went to look for the Amulet. And if we&rsquo;d found it we
      should remember that too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather!&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;Only, you see we haven&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But in the future we shall have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we, though?&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;unless we&rsquo;ve been made fools of by the Psammead. So then, where
      we want to go to is where we shall remember about where we did find it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Robert, but he didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Anthea, who did, very nearly. &lsquo;Say it again,
      Squirrel, and very slowly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If,&rsquo; said Cyril, very slowly indeed, &lsquo;we go into the future&mdash;after
      we&rsquo;ve found the Amulet&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to find it first,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There will be a future,&rsquo; said Cyril, driven to greater clearness by the
      blank faces of the other three, &lsquo;there will be a time AFTER we&rsquo;ve found
      it. Let&rsquo;s go into THAT time&mdash;and then we shall remember HOW we found
      it. And then we can go back and do the finding really.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Robert, and this time he did, and I hope YOU do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Oh, Squirrel, how clever of you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But will the Amulet work both ways?&rsquo; inquired Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ought to,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;if time&rsquo;s only a thingummy of whatsitsname.
      Anyway we might try.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s put on our best things, then,&rsquo; urged Jane. &lsquo;You know what people
      say about progress and the world growing better and brighter. I expect
      people will be awfully smart in the future.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;we should have to wash anyway, I&rsquo;m all thick
      with glue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When everyone was clean and dressed, the charm was held up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to go into the future and see the Amulet after we&rsquo;ve found it,&rsquo; 
      said Cyril, and Jane said the word of Power. They walked through the big
      arch of the charm straight into the British Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knew it at once, and there, right in front of them, under a glass
      case, was the Amulet&mdash;their own half of it, as well as the other half
      they had never been able to find&mdash;and the two were joined by a pin of
      red stone that formed a hinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, glorious!&rsquo; cried Robert. &lsquo;Here it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Cyril, very gloomily, &lsquo;here it is. But we can&rsquo;t get it out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Robert, remembering how impossible the Queen of Babylon had
      found it to get anything out of the glass cases in the Museum&mdash;except
      by Psammead magic, and then she hadn&rsquo;t been able to take anything away
      with her; &lsquo;no&mdash;but we remember where we got it, and we can&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, DO we?&rsquo; interrupted Cyril bitterly, &lsquo;do YOU remember where we got
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly, now I come to think of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did any of the others!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But WHY can&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; Cyril&rsquo;s tone was impatient, &lsquo;some silly old
      enchanted rule I suppose. I wish people would teach you magic at school
      like they do sums&mdash;or instead of. It would be some use having an
      Amulet then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder how far we are in the future,&rsquo; said Anthea; the Museum looks
      just the same, only lighter and brighter, somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go back and try the Past again,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps the Museum people could tell us how we got it,&rsquo; said Anthea with
      sudden hope. There was no one in the room, but in the next gallery, where
      the Assyrian things are and still were, they found a kind, stout man in a
      loose, blue gown, and stockinged legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ve got a new uniform, how pretty!&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they asked him their question he showed them a label on the case. It
      said, &lsquo;From the collection of&mdash;.&rsquo; A name followed, and it was the
      name of the learned gentleman who, among themselves, and to his face when
      he had been with them at the other side of the Amulet, they had called
      Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;THAT&rsquo;S not much good,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it you&rsquo;re not at school?&rsquo; asked the kind man in blue. &lsquo;Not
      expelled for long I hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not expelled at all,&rsquo; said Cyril rather warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t do it again, if I were you,&rsquo; said the man, and they
      could see he did not believe them. There is no company so little pleasing
      as that of people who do not believe you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you for showing us the label,&rsquo; said Cyril. And they came away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came through the doors of the Museum they blinked at the sudden
      glory of sunlight and blue sky. The houses opposite the Museum were gone.
      Instead there was a big garden, with trees and flowers and smooth green
      lawns, and not a single notice to tell you not to walk on the grass and
      not to destroy the trees and shrubs and not to pick the flowers. There
      were comfortable seats all about, and arbours covered with roses, and
      long, trellised walks, also rose-covered. Whispering, splashing fountains
      fell into full white marble basins, white statues gleamed among the
      leaves, and the pigeons that swept about among the branches or pecked on
      the smooth, soft gravel were not black and tumbled like the Museum pigeons
      are now, but bright and clean and sleek as birds of new silver. A good
      many people were sitting on the seats, and on the grass babies were
      rolling and kicking and playing&mdash;with very little on indeed. Men, as
      well as women, seemed to be in charge of the babies and were playing with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like a lovely picture,&rsquo; said Anthea, and it was. For the people&rsquo;s
      clothes were of bright, soft colours and all beautifully and very simply
      made. No one seemed to have any hats or bonnets, but there were a great
      many Japanese-looking sunshades. And among the trees were hung lamps of
      coloured glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I expect they light those in the evening,&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;I do wish we lived
      in the future!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked down the path, and as they went the people on the benches
      looked at the four children very curiously, but not rudely or unkindly.
      The children, in their turn, looked&mdash;I hope they did not stare&mdash;at
      the faces of these people in the beautiful soft clothes. Those faces were
      worth looking at. Not that they were all handsome, though even in the
      matter of handsomeness they had the advantage of any set of people the
      children had ever seen. But it was the expression of their faces that made
      them worth looking at. The children could not tell at first what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Anthea suddenly. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re not worried; that&rsquo;s what it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was. Everybody looked calm, no one seemed to be in a hurry, no one
      seemed to be anxious, or fretted, and though some did seem to be sad, not
      a single one looked worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though the people looked kind everyone looked so interested in the
      children that they began to feel a little shy and turned out of the big
      main path into a narrow little one that wound among trees and shrubs and
      mossy, dripping springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here, in a deep, shadowed cleft between tall cypresses, that they
      found the expelled little boy. He was lying face downward on the mossy
      turf, and the peculiar shaking of his shoulders was a thing they had seen,
      more than once, in each other. So Anthea kneeled down by him and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m expelled from school,&rsquo; said the boy between his sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was serious. People are not expelled for light offences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mind telling us what you&rsquo;d done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I tore up a sheet of paper and threw it about in the playground,&rsquo; 
      said the child, in the tone of one confessing an unutterable baseness.
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t talk to me any more now you know that,&rsquo; he added without
      looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was that all?&rsquo; asked Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s about enough,&rsquo; said the child; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m expelled for the whole day!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rsquo; said Anthea, gently. The boy lifted his face,
      rolled over, and sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, whoever on earth are you?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re strangers from a far country,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;In our country it&rsquo;s
      not a crime to leave a bit of paper about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is here,&rsquo; said the child. &lsquo;If grown-ups do it they&rsquo;re fined. When we
      do it we&rsquo;re expelled for the whole day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;that just means a day&rsquo;s holiday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You MUST come from a long way off,&rsquo; said the little boy. &lsquo;A holiday&rsquo;s
      when you all have play and treats and jolliness, all of you together. On
      your expelled days no one&rsquo;ll speak to you. Everyone sees you&rsquo;re an
      Expelleder or you&rsquo;d be in school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose you were ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody is&mdash;hardly. If they are, of course they wear the badge, and
      everyone is kind to you. I know a boy that stole his sister&rsquo;s illness
      badge and wore it when he was expelled for a day. HE got expelled for a
      week for that. It must be awful not to go to school for a week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you LIKE school, then?&rsquo; asked Robert incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do. It&rsquo;s the loveliest place there is. I chose railways for
      my special subject this year, there are such splendid models and things,
      and now I shall be all behind because of that torn-up paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You choose your own subject?&rsquo; asked Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, of course. Where DID you come from? Don&rsquo;t you know ANYTHING?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Jane definitely; &lsquo;so you&rsquo;d better tell us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, on Midsummer Day school breaks up and everything&rsquo;s decorated with
      flowers, and you choose your special subject for next year. Of course you
      have to stick to it for a year at least. Then there are all your other
      subjects, of course, reading, and painting, and the rules of Citizenship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious!&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said the child, jumping up, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s nearly four. The
      expelledness only lasts till then. Come home with me. Mother will tell you
      all about everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will your mother like you taking home strange children?&rsquo; asked Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; said the child, settling his leather belt over his
      honey-coloured smock and stepping out with hard little bare feet. &lsquo;Come
      on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were wide and hard and very clean. There were no horses, but a
      sort of motor carriage that made no noise. The Thames flowed between green
      banks, and there were trees at the edge, and people sat under them,
      fishing, for the stream was clear as crystal. Everywhere there were green
      trees and there was no smoke. The houses were set in what seemed like one
      green garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy brought them to a house, and at the window was a good,
      bright mother-face. The little boy rushed in, and through the window they
      could see him hugging his mother, then his eager lips moving and his quick
      hands pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady in soft green clothes came out, spoke kindly to them, and took them
      into the oddest house they had ever seen. It was very bare, there were no
      ornaments, and yet every single thing was beautiful, from the dresser with
      its rows of bright china, to the thick squares of Eastern-looking carpet
      on the floors. I can&rsquo;t describe that house; I haven&rsquo;t the time. And I
      haven&rsquo;t heart either, when I think how different it was from our houses.
      The lady took them all over it. The oddest thing of all was the big room
      in the middle. It had padded walls and a soft, thick carpet, and all the
      chairs and tables were padded. There wasn&rsquo;t a single thing in it that
      anyone could hurt itself with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What ever&rsquo;s this for?&mdash;lunatics?&rsquo; asked Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady looked very shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! It&rsquo;s for the children, of course,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that in
      your country there are no children&rsquo;s rooms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are nurseries,&rsquo; said Anthea doubtfully, &lsquo;but the furniture&rsquo;s all
      cornery and hard, like other rooms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How shocking!&rsquo; said the lady; &lsquo;you must be VERY much behind the times in
      your country! Why, the children are more than half of the people; it&rsquo;s not
      much to have one room where they can have a good time and not hurt
      themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s no fireplace,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hot-air pipes, of course,&rsquo; said the lady. &lsquo;Why, how could you have a fire
      in a nursery? A child might get burned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In our country,&rsquo; said Robert suddenly, &lsquo;more than 3,000 children are
      burned to death every year. Father told me,&rsquo; he added, as if apologizing
      for this piece of information, &lsquo;once when I&rsquo;d been playing with fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady turned quite pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a frightful place you must live in!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all the
      furniture padded for?&rsquo; Anthea asked, hastily turning the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you couldn&rsquo;t have little tots of two or three running about in rooms
      where the things were hard and sharp! They might hurt themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert fingered the scar on his forehead where he had hit it against the
      nursery fender when he was little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But does everyone have rooms like this, poor people and all?&rsquo; asked
      Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a room like this wherever there&rsquo;s a child, of course,&rsquo; said the
      lady. &lsquo;How refreshingly ignorant you are!&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t mean ignorant,
      my dear. Of course, you&rsquo;re awfully well up in ancient History. But I see
      you haven&rsquo;t done your Duties of Citizenship Course yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But beggars, and people like that?&rsquo; persisted Anthea &lsquo;and tramps and
      people who haven&rsquo;t any homes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;People who haven&rsquo;t any homes?&rsquo; repeated the lady. &lsquo;I really DON&rsquo;T
      understand what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all different in our country,&rsquo; said Cyril carefully; and I have read
      it used to be different in London. Usedn&rsquo;t people to have no homes and beg
      because they were hungry? And wasn&rsquo;t London very black and dirty once upon
      a time? And the Thames all muddy and filthy? And narrow streets, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have been reading very old-fashioned books,&rsquo; said the lady.
      &lsquo;Why, all that was in the dark ages! My husband can tell you more about it
      than I can. He took Ancient History as one of his special subjects.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any working people,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, we&rsquo;re all working people,&rsquo; said the lady; &lsquo;at least my husband&rsquo;s a
      carpenter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good gracious!&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;but you&rsquo;re a lady!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;that quaint old word! Well, my husband WILL enjoy a
      talk with you. In the dark ages everyone was allowed to have a smoky
      chimney, and those nasty horses all over the streets, and all sorts of
      rubbish thrown into the Thames. And, of course, the sufferings of the
      people will hardly bear thinking of. It&rsquo;s very learned of you to know it
      all. Did you make Ancient History your special subject?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; said Cyril, rather uneasily. &lsquo;What is the Duties of
      Citizenship Course about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you REALLY know? Aren&rsquo;t you pretending&mdash;just for fun? Really
      not? Well, that course teaches you how to be a good citizen, what you must
      do and what you mayn&rsquo;t do, so as to do your full share of the work of
      making your town a beautiful and happy place for people to live in.
      There&rsquo;s a quite simple little thing they teach the tiny children. How does
      it go...?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;I must not steal and I must learn,
   Nothing is mine that I do not earn.
   I must try in work and play
   To make things beautiful every day.
   I must be kind to everyone,
   And never let cruel things be done.
   I must be brave, and I must try
   When I am hurt never to cry,
   And always laugh as much as I can,
   And be glad that I&rsquo;m going to be a man
   To work for my living and help the rest
   And never do less than my very best.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very easy,&rsquo; said Jane. &lsquo;<i>I</i> could remember that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s only the very beginning, of course,&rsquo; said the lady; &lsquo;there are
      heaps more rhymes. There&rsquo;s the one beginning&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;I must not litter the beautiful street
   With bits of paper or things to eat;
   I must not pick the public flowers,
   They are not MINE, but they are OURS.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And &ldquo;things to eat&rdquo; reminds me&mdash;are you hungry? Wells, run and get a
      tray of nice things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you call him &ldquo;Wells&rdquo;?&rsquo; asked Robert, as the boy ran off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s after the great reformer&mdash;surely you&rsquo;ve heard of HIM? He lived
      in the dark ages, and he saw that what you ought to do is to find out what
      you want and then try to get it. Up to then people had always tried to
      tinker up what they&rsquo;d got. We&rsquo;ve got a great many of the things he thought
      of. Then &ldquo;Wells&rdquo; means springs of clear water. It&rsquo;s a nice name, don&rsquo;t you
      think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Wells returned with strawberries and cakes and lemonade on a tray,
      and everybody ate and enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Wells,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;run off or you&rsquo;ll be late and not meet your
      Daddy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wells kissed her, waved to the others, and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said Anthea suddenly, &lsquo;would you like to come to OUR country,
      and see what it&rsquo;s like? It wouldn&rsquo;t take you a minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady laughed. But Jane held up the charm and said the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a splendid conjuring trick!&rsquo; cried the lady, enchanted with the
      beautiful, growing arch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go through,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady went, laughing. But she did not laugh when she found herself,
      suddenly, in the dining-room at Fitzroy Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what a HORRIBLE trick!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;What a hateful, dark, ugly
      place!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the window and looked out. The sky was grey, the street was
      foggy, a dismal organ-grinder was standing opposite the door, a beggar and
      a man who sold matches were quarrelling at the edge of the pavement on
      whose greasy black surface people hurried along, hastening to get to the
      shelter of their houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, look at their faces, their horrible faces!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with them all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re poor people, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s NOT all! They&rsquo;re ill, they&rsquo;re unhappy, they&rsquo;re wicked! Oh, do
      stop it, there&rsquo;s dear children. It&rsquo;s very, very clever. Some sort of
      magic-lantern trick, I suppose, like I&rsquo;ve read of. But DO stop it. Oh!
      their poor, tired, miserable, wicked faces!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears were in her eyes. Anthea signed to Jane. The arch grew, they
      spoke the words, and pushed the lady through it into her own time and
      place, where London is clean and beautiful, and the Thames runs clear and
      bright, and the green trees grow, and no one is afraid, or anxious, or in
      a hurry. There was a silence. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad we went,&rsquo; said Anthea, with a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never throw paper about again as long as I live,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother always told us not to,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would like to take up the Duties of Citizenship for a special subject,&rsquo; 
      said Cyril. &lsquo;I wonder if Father could put me through it. I shall ask him
      when he comes home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we&rsquo;d found the Amulet, Father could be home NOW,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;and
      Mother and The Lamb.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the future AGAIN,&rsquo; suggested Jane brightly. &lsquo;Perhaps we
      could remember if it wasn&rsquo;t such an awful way off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they did. This time they said, &lsquo;The future, where the Amulet is, not so
      far away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And they went through the familiar arch into a large, light room with
      three windows. Facing them was the familiar mummy-case. And at a table by
      the window sat the learned gentleman. They knew him at once, though his
      hair was white. He was one of the faces that do not change with age. In
      his hand was the Amulet&mdash;complete and perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his other hand across his forehead in the way they were so used
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dreams, dreams!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;old age is full of them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been in dreams with us before now,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you
      remember?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do, indeed,&rsquo; said he. The room had many more books than the Fitzroy
      Street room, and far more curious and wonderful Assyrian and Egyptian
      objects. &lsquo;The most wonderful dreams I ever had had you in them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where,&rsquo; asked Cyril, &lsquo;did you get that thing in your hand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you weren&rsquo;t just a dream,&rsquo; he answered, smiling, you&rsquo;d remember that
      you gave it to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where did we get it?&rsquo; Cyril asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you never would tell me that,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;You always had your little
      mysteries. You dear children! What a difference you made to that old
      Bloomsbury house! I wish I could dream you oftener. Now you&rsquo;re grown up
      you&rsquo;re not like you used to be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grown up?&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman pointed to a frame with four photographs in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you are,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children saw four grown-up people&rsquo;s portraits&mdash;two ladies, two
      gentlemen&mdash;and looked on them with loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we grow up like THAT?&rsquo; whispered Jane. &lsquo;How perfectly horrid!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we&rsquo;re ever like that, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s horrid, I expect,&rsquo; Anthea
      with some insight whispered back. &lsquo;You see, you get used to yourself while
      you&rsquo;re changing. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s being so sudden makes it seem so
      frightful now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman was looking at them with wistful kindness. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      let me undream you just yet,&rsquo; he said. There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remember WHEN we gave you that Amulet?&rsquo; Cyril asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know, or you would if you weren&rsquo;t a dream, that it was on the 3rd
      December, 1905. I shall never forget THAT day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Cyril, earnestly; &lsquo;oh, thank you very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a new room,&rsquo; said Anthea, looking out of the window, &lsquo;and what
      a lovely garden!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m too old now to care even about being near the Museum.
      This is a beautiful place. Do you know&mdash;I can hardly believe you&rsquo;re
      just a dream, you do look so exactly real. Do you know...&rsquo; his voice
      dropped, &lsquo;I can say it to YOU, though, of course, if I said it to anyone
      that wasn&rsquo;t a dream they&rsquo;d call me mad; there was something about that
      Amulet you gave me&mdash;something very mysterious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was that,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t mean your pretty little childish mysteries about where you
      got it. But about the thing itself. First, the wonderful dreams I used to
      have, after you&rsquo;d shown me the first half of it! Why, my book on Atlantis,
      that I did, was the beginning of my fame and my fortune, too. And I got it
      all out of a dream! And then, &ldquo;Britain at the Time of the Roman Invasion&rdquo;&mdash;that
      was only a pamphlet, but it explained a lot of things people hadn&rsquo;t
      understood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;it would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was the beginning. But after you&rsquo;d given me the whole of the Amulet&mdash;ah,
      it was generous of you!&mdash;then, somehow, I didn&rsquo;t need to theorize, I
      seemed to KNOW about the old Egyptian civilization. And they can&rsquo;t upset
      my theories&rsquo;&mdash;he rubbed his thin hands and laughed triumphantly&mdash;&lsquo;they
      can&rsquo;t, though they&rsquo;ve tried. Theories, they call them, but they&rsquo;re more
      like&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;more like memories. I KNOW I&rsquo;m right about
      the secret rites of the Temple of Amen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re rich,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;You weren&rsquo;t, you know, at Fitzroy
      Street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I wasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but I am now. This beautiful house and this
      lovely garden&mdash;I dig in it sometimes; you remember, you used to tell
      me to take more exercise? Well, I feel I owe it all to you&mdash;and the
      Amulet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rsquo; said Anthea, and kissed him. He started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;THAT didn&rsquo;t feel like a dream,&rsquo; he said, and his voice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly a dream,&rsquo; said Anthea softly, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all part of the
      Amulet&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sort of extra special, real dream, dear Jimmy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;when you call me that, I know I&rsquo;m dreaming. My little
      sister&mdash;I dream of her sometimes. But it&rsquo;s not real like this. Do you
      remember the day I dreamed you brought me the Babylonish ring?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We remember it all,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;Did you leave Fitzroy Street because
      you were too rich for it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; he said reproachfully. &lsquo;You know I should never have done such a
      thing as that. Of course, I left when your old Nurse died and&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      the matter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Nurse DEAD?&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Oh, NO!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s the common lot. It&rsquo;s a long time ago now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane held up the Amulet in a hand that twittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;oh, come home! She may be dead before we get there,
      and then we can&rsquo;t give it to her. Oh, come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t let the dream end now!&rsquo; pleaded the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must,&rsquo; said Anthea firmly, and kissed him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When it comes to people dying,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;good-bye! I&rsquo;m so glad
      you&rsquo;re rich and famous and happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DO come!&rsquo; cried Jane, stamping in her agony of impatience. And they went.
      Old Nurse brought in tea almost as soon as they were back in Fitzroy
      Street. As she came in with the tray, the girls rushed at her and nearly
      upset her and it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t die!&rsquo; cried Jane, &lsquo;oh, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; and Anthea cried, &lsquo;Dear, ducky,
      darling old Nurse, don&rsquo;t die!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord, love you!&rsquo; said Nurse, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not agoin&rsquo; to die yet a while, please
      Heaven! Whatever on earth&rsquo;s the matter with the chicks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing. Only don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the tray down and hugged the girls in turn. The boys thumped her
      on the back with heartfelt affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m as well as ever I was in my life,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;What nonsense about
      dying! You&rsquo;ve been a sitting too long in the dusk, that&rsquo;s what it is.
      Regular blind man&rsquo;s holiday. Leave go of me, while I light the gas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow light illuminated four pale faces. &lsquo;We do love you so,&rsquo; Anthea
      went on, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;ve made you a picture to show you how we love you. Get it
      out, Squirrel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The glazed testimonial was dragged out from under the sofa and displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The glue&rsquo;s not dry yet,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;look out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a beauty!&rsquo; cried old Nurse. &lsquo;Well, I never! And your pictures and
      the beautiful writing and all. Well, I always did say your hearts was in
      the right place, if a bit careless at times. Well! I never did! I don&rsquo;t
      know as I was ever pleased better in my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hugged them all, one after the other. And the boys did not mind it,
      somehow, that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it we can remember all about the future, NOW?&rsquo; Anthea woke the
      Psammead with laborious gentleness to put the question. &lsquo;How is it we can
      remember what we saw in the future, and yet, when we WERE in the future,
      we could not remember the bit of the future that was past then, the time
      of finding the Amulet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what a silly question!&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;of course you cannot
      remember what hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the FUTURE hasn&rsquo;t happened yet,&rsquo; Anthea persisted, &lsquo;and we remember
      that all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s happened, my good child,&rsquo; said the Psammead, rather
      crossly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s prophetic vision. And you remember dreams, don&rsquo;t you? So
      why not visions? You never do seem to understand the simplest thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It went to sand again at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea crept down in her nightgown to give one last kiss to old Nurse, and
      one last look at the beautiful testimonial hanging, by its tapes, its glue
      now firmly set, in glazed glory on the wall of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, bless your loving heart,&rsquo; said old Nurse, &lsquo;if only you don&rsquo;t
      catch your deather-cold!&rsquo; 
    </p>

      CHAPTER 13. THE SHIPWRECK ON THE TIN ISLANDS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;Blue and red,&rsquo; said Jane softly, &lsquo;make purple.&rsquo; 
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not always they don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;it has to be crimson lake and
      Prussian blue. If you mix Vermilion and Indigo you get the most loathsome
      slate colour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sepia&rsquo;s the nastiest colour in the box, I think,&rsquo; said Jane, sucking her
      brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all painting. Nurse in the flush of grateful emotion, excited by
      Robert&rsquo;s border of poppies, had presented each of the four with a shilling
      paint-box, and had supplemented the gift with a pile of old copies of the
      Illustrated London News.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sepia,&rsquo; said Cyril instructively, &lsquo;is made out of beastly cuttlefish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Purple&rsquo;s made out of a fish, as well as out of red and blue,&rsquo; said
      Robert. &lsquo;Tyrian purple was, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of lobsters?&rsquo; said Jane dreamily. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re red when they&rsquo;re boiled,
      and blue when they aren&rsquo;t. If you mixed live and dead lobsters you&rsquo;d get
      Tyrian purple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> shouldn&rsquo;t like to mix anything with a live lobster,&rsquo; said
      Anthea, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, there aren&rsquo;t any other red and blue fish,&rsquo; said Jane; &lsquo;you&rsquo;d have
      to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather not have the purple,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Tyrian purple wasn&rsquo;t that colour when it came out of the fish, nor
      yet afterwards, it wasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Robert; &lsquo;it was scarlet really, and Roman
      Emperors wore it. And it wasn&rsquo;t any nice colour while the fish had it. It
      was a yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; asked Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I read it,&rsquo; said Robert, with the meek pride of superior knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; asked Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In print,&rsquo; said Robert, still more proudly meek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think everything&rsquo;s true if it&rsquo;s printed,&rsquo; said Cyril, naturally
      annoyed, &lsquo;but it isn&rsquo;t. Father said so. Quite a lot of lies get printed,
      especially in newspapers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, as it happens,&rsquo; said Robert, in what was really a rather
      annoying tone, &lsquo;it wasn&rsquo;t a newspaper, it was in a book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How sweet Chinese white is!&rsquo; said Jane, dreamily sucking her brush again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said Cyril to Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have a suck yourself,&rsquo; suggested Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean about the Chinese white. I mean about the cream fish turning
      purple and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Anthea, jumping up very quickly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired of painting. Let&rsquo;s
      go somewhere by Amulet. I say let&rsquo;s let IT choose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril and Robert agreed that this was an idea. Jane consented to stop
      painting because, as she said, Chinese white, though certainly sweet,
      gives you a queer feeling in the back of the throat if you paint with it
      too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Amulet was held up. &lsquo;Take us somewhere,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;anywhere you like
      in the Past&mdash;but somewhere where you are.&rsquo; Then she said the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment everyone felt a queer rocking and swaying&mdash;something like
      what you feel when you go out in a fishing boat. And that was not
      wonderful, when you come to think of it, for it was in a boat that they
      found themselves. A queer boat, with high bulwarks pierced with holes for
      oars to go through. There was a high seat for the steersman, and the prow
      was shaped like the head of some great animal with big, staring eyes. The
      boat rode at anchor in a bay, and the bay was very smooth. The crew were
      dark, wiry fellows with black beards and hair. They had no clothes except
      a tunic from waist to knee, and round caps with knobs on the top. They
      were very busy, and what they were doing was so interesting to the
      children that at first they did not even wonder where the Amulet had
      brought them. And the crew seemed too busy to notice the children. They
      were fastening rush baskets to a long rope with a great piece of cork at
      the end, and in each basket they put mussels or little frogs. Then they
      cast out the rope, the baskets sank, but the cork floated. And all about
      on the blue water were other boats and all the crews of all the boats were
      busy with ropes and baskets and frogs and mussels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever are you doing?&rsquo; Jane suddenly asked a man who had rather more
      clothes than the others, and seemed to be a sort of captain or overseer.
      He started and stared at her, but he had seen too many strange lands to be
      very much surprised at these queerly-dressed stowaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Setting lines for the dye shell-fish,&rsquo; he said shortly. &lsquo;How did you get
      here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sort of magic,&rsquo; said Robert carelessly. The Captain fingered an Amulet
      that hung round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this place?&rsquo; asked Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tyre, of course,&rsquo; said the man. Then he drew back and spoke in a low
      voice to one of the sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we shall know about your precious cream-jug fish,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we never SAID come to Tyre,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Amulet heard us talking, I expect. I think it&rsquo;s MOST obliging of it,&rsquo; 
      said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the Amulet&rsquo;s here too,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;We ought to be able to find it
      in a little ship like this. I wonder which of them&rsquo;s got it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;look, look!&rsquo; cried Anthea suddenly. On the bare breast of one of
      the sailors gleamed something red. It was the exact counterpart of their
      precious half-Amulet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence, full of emotion, was broken by Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then we&rsquo;ve found it!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Oh do let&rsquo;s take it and go home!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Easy to say &ldquo;take it&rdquo;,&rsquo; said Cyril; &lsquo;he looks very strong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did&mdash;yet not so strong as the other sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s odd,&rsquo; said Anthea musingly, &lsquo;I do believe I&rsquo;ve seen that man
      somewhere before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s rather like our learned gentleman,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell you
      who he&rsquo;s much more like&mdash;&rsquo; At that moment that sailor looked up. His
      eyes met Robert&rsquo;s&mdash;and Robert and the others had no longer any doubt
      as to where they had seen him before. It was Rekh-mara, the priest who had
      led them to the palace of Pharaoh&mdash;and whom Jane had looked back at
      through the arch, when he was counselling Pharaoh&rsquo;s guard to take the
      jewels and fly for his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody was quite pleased, and nobody quite knew why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane voiced the feelings of all when she said, fingering THEIR Amulet
      through the folds of her frock, &lsquo;We can go back in a minute if anything
      nasty happens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment nothing worse happened than an offer of food&mdash;figs and
      cucumbers it was, and very pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said the Captain, &lsquo;that you are from a far country. Since you
      have honoured my boat by appearing on it, you must stay here till morning.
      Then I will lead you to one of our great ones. He loves strangers from far
      lands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go home,&rsquo; Jane whispered, &lsquo;all the frogs are drowning NOW. I think
      the people here are cruel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boys wanted to stay and see the lines taken up in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just like eel-pots and lobster-pots,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;the baskets only
      open from outside&mdash;I vote we stay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Tyre over there,&rsquo; said the Captain, who was evidently trying to be
      civil. He pointed to a great island rock, that rose steeply from the sea,
      crowned with huge walls and towers. There was another city on the
      mainland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s part of Tyre, too,&rsquo; said the Captain; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s where the great
      merchants have their pleasure-houses and gardens and farms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look, look!&rsquo; Cyril cried suddenly; &lsquo;what a lovely little ship!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A ship in full sail was passing swiftly through the fishing fleet. The
      Captain&rsquo;s face changed. He frowned, and his eyes blazed with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Insolent young barbarian!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Do you call the ships of Tyre
      LITTLE? None greater sail the seas. That ship has been on a three years&rsquo; 
      voyage. She is known in all the great trading ports from here to the Tin
      Islands. She comes back rich and glorious. Her very anchor is of silver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure we beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Anthea hastily. &lsquo;In our country we say
      &ldquo;little&rdquo; for a pet name. Your wife might call you her dear little husband,
      you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to catch her at it,&rsquo; growled the Captain, but he stopped
      scowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a rich trade,&rsquo; he went on. &lsquo;For cloth ONCE dipped, second-best
      glass, and the rough images our young artists carve for practice, the
      barbarian King in Tessos lets us work the silver mines. We get so much
      silver there that we leave them our iron anchors and come back with silver
      ones.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How splendid!&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;Do go on. What&rsquo;s cloth once dipped?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You MUST be barbarians from the outer darkness,&rsquo; said the Captain
      scornfully. &lsquo;All wealthy nations know that our finest stuffs are twice
      dyed&mdash;dibaptha. They&rsquo;re only for the robes of kings and priests and
      princes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do the rich merchants wear,&rsquo; asked Jane, with interest, &lsquo;in the
      pleasure-houses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They wear the dibaptha. OUR merchants ARE princes,&rsquo; scowled the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be cross, we do so like hearing about things. We want to know
      ALL about the dyeing,&rsquo; said Anthea cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you do, do you?&rsquo; growled the man. &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re here for?
      Well, you won&rsquo;t get the secrets of the dye trade out of ME.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away, and everyone felt snubbed and uncomfortable. And all the
      time the long, narrow eyes of the Egyptian were watching, watching. They
      felt as though he was watching them through the darkness, when they lay
      down to sleep on a pile of cloaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the baskets were drawn up full of what looked like whelk
      shells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were rather in the way, but they made themselves as small as
      they could. While the skipper was at the other end of the boat they did
      ask one question of a sailor, whose face was a little less unkind than the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;this is the dye-fish. It&rsquo;s a sort of murex&mdash;and
      there&rsquo;s another kind that they catch at Sidon and then, of course, there&rsquo;s
      the kind that&rsquo;s used for the dibaptha. But that&rsquo;s quite different. It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue!&rsquo; shouted the skipper. And the man held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laden boat was rowed slowly round the end of the island, and was made
      fast in one of the two great harbours that lay inside a long breakwater.
      The harbour was full of all sorts of ships, so that Cyril and Robert
      enjoyed themselves much more than their sisters. The breakwater and the
      quays were heaped with bales and baskets, and crowded with slaves and
      sailors. Farther along some men were practising diving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s jolly good,&rsquo; said Robert, as a naked brown body cleft the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think so,&rsquo; said the skipper. &lsquo;The pearl-divers of Persia are not
      more skilful. Why, we&rsquo;ve got a fresh-water spring that comes out at the
      bottom of the sea. Our divers dive down and bring up the fresh water in
      skin bottles! Can your barbarian divers do as much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose not,&rsquo; said Robert, and put away a wild desire to explain to the
      Captain the English system of waterworks, pipes, taps, and the intricacies
      of the plumbers&rsquo; trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they neared the quay the skipper made a hasty toilet. He did his hair,
      combed his beard, put on a garment like a jersey with short sleeves, an
      embroidered belt, a necklace of beads, and a big signet ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fit to be seen. Come along?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where to?&rsquo; said Jane cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Pheles, the great sea-captain, said the skipper, &lsquo;the man I told you
      of, who loves barbarians.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Rekh-mara came forward, and, for the first time, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have known these children in another land,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You know my
      powers of magic. It was my magic that brought these barbarians to your
      boat. And you know how they will profit you. I read your thoughts. Let me
      come with you and see the end of them, and then I will work the spell I
      promised you in return for the little experience you have so kindly given
      me on your boat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The skipper looked at the Egyptian with some disfavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it was YOUR doing,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I might have guessed it. Well, come on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he came, and the girls wished he hadn&rsquo;t. But Robert whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense&mdash;as long as he&rsquo;s with us we&rsquo;ve got some chance of the
      Amulet. We can always fly if anything goes wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was so fresh and bright; their breakfast had been so good and
      so unusual; they had actually seen the Amulet round the Egyptian&rsquo;s neck.
      One or two, or all these things, suddenly raised the children&rsquo;s spirits.
      They went off quite cheerfully through the city gate&mdash;it was not
      arched, but roofed over with a great flat stone&mdash;and so through the
      street, which smelt horribly of fish and garlic and a thousand other
      things even less agreeable. But far worse than the street scents was the
      scent of the factory, where the skipper called in to sell his night&rsquo;s
      catch. I wish I could tell you all about that factory, but I haven&rsquo;t time,
      and perhaps after all you aren&rsquo;t interested in dyeing works. I will only
      mention that Robert was triumphantly proved to be right. The dye WAS a
      yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency, and it smelt more strongly
      of garlic than garlic itself does.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the skipper was bargaining with the master of the dye works the
      Egyptian came close to the children, and said, suddenly and softly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trust me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we could,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You feel,&rsquo; said the Egyptian, &lsquo;that I want your Amulet. That makes you
      distrust me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Cyril bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you also, you want my Amulet, and I am trusting you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have the two halves of the Amulet,&rsquo; said the Priest, &lsquo;but not yet the
      pin that joined them. Our only chance of getting that is to remain
      together. Once part these two halves and they may never be found in the
      same time and place. Be wise. Our interests are the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before anyone could say more the skipper came back, and with him the
      dye-master. His hair and beard were curled like the men&rsquo;s in Babylon, and
      he was dressed like the skipper, but with added grandeur of gold and
      embroidery. He had necklaces of beads and silver, and a glass amulet with
      a man&rsquo;s face, very like his own, set between two bull&rsquo;s heads, as well as
      gold and silver bracelets and armlets. He looked keenly at the children.
      Then he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother Pheles has just come back from Tarshish. He&rsquo;s at his garden
      house&mdash;unless he&rsquo;s hunting wild boar in the marshes. He gets
      frightfully bored on shore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the skipper, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a true-born Phoenician. &ldquo;Tyre, Tyre for
      ever! Oh, Tyre rules the waves!&rdquo; as the old song says. I&rsquo;ll go at once,
      and show him my young barbarians.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should,&rsquo; said the dye-master. &lsquo;They are very rum, aren&rsquo;t they? What
      frightful clothes, and what a lot of them! Observe the covering of their
      feet. Hideous indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert could not help thinking how easy, and at the same time pleasant, it
      would be to catch hold of the dye-master&rsquo;s feet and tip him backward into
      the great sunken vat just near him. But if he had, flight would have had
      to be the next move, so he restrained his impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something about this Tyrian adventure that was different from
      all the others. It was, somehow, calmer. And there was the undoubted fact
      that the charm was there on the neck of the Egyptian.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they enjoyed everything to the full, the row from the Island City to
      the shore, the ride on the donkeys that the skipper hired at the gate of
      the mainland city, and the pleasant country&mdash;palms and figs and
      cedars all about. It was like a garden&mdash;clematis, honeysuckle, and
      jasmine clung about the olive and mulberry trees, and there were tulips
      and gladiolus, and clumps of mandrake, which has bell-flowers that look as
      though they were cut out of dark blue jewels. In the distance were the
      mountains of Lebanon. The house they came to at last was rather like a
      bungalow&mdash;long and low, with pillars all along the front. Cedars and
      sycamores grew near it and sheltered it pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone dismounted, and the donkeys were led away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why is this like Rosherville?&rsquo; whispered Robert, and instantly supplied
      the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it&rsquo;s the place to spend a happy day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s jolly decent of the skipper to have brought us to such a ripping
      place,&rsquo; said Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;this feels more real than anything else we&rsquo;ve
      seen? It&rsquo;s like a holiday in the country at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were left alone in a large hall. The floor was mosaic, done
      with wonderful pictures of ships and sea-beasts and fishes. Through an
      open doorway they could see a pleasant courtyard with flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to spend a week here,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;and donkey ride every
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was feeling very jolly. Even the Egyptian looked pleasanter than
      usual. And then, quite suddenly, the skipper came back with a joyous
      smile. With him came the master of the house. He looked steadily at the
      children and nodded twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my steward will pay you the price. But I shall not pay at
      that high rate for the Egyptian dog.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the Egyptian, &lsquo;is a pretty kettle of fish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is?&rsquo; asked all the children at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our present position,&rsquo; said Rekh-mara. &lsquo;Our seafaring friend,&rsquo; he added,
      &lsquo;has sold us all for slaves!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A hasty council succeeded the shock of this announcement. The Priest was
      allowed to take part in it. His advice was &lsquo;stay&rsquo;, because they were in no
      danger, and the Amulet in its completeness must be somewhere near, or, of
      course, they could not have come to that place at all. And after some
      discussion they agreed to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were treated more as guests than as slaves, but the Egyptian
      was sent to the kitchen and made to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pheles, the master of the house, went off that very evening, by the King&rsquo;s
      orders, to start on another voyage. And when he was gone his wife found
      the children amusing company, and kept them talking and singing and
      dancing till quite late. &lsquo;To distract my mind from my sorrows,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do like being a slave,&rsquo; remarked Jane cheerfully, as they curled up on
      the big, soft cushions that were to be their beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was black night when they were awakened, each by a hand passed softly
      over its face, and a low voice that whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be quiet, or all is lost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they were quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s me, Rekh-mara, the Priest of Amen,&rsquo; said the whisperer. &lsquo;The man who
      brought us has gone to sea again, and he has taken my Amulet from me by
      force, and I know no magic to get it back. Is there magic for that in the
      Amulet you bear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was instantly awake by now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can go after him,&rsquo; said Cyril, leaping up; &lsquo;but he might take OURS as
      well; or he might be angry with us for following him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see to THAT,&rsquo; said the Egyptian in the dark. &lsquo;Hide your Amulet
      well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There in the deep blackness of that room in the Tyrian country house the
      Amulet was once more held up and the word spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      All passed through on to a ship that tossed and tumbled on a wind-blown
      sea. They crouched together there till morning, and Jane and Cyril were
      not at all well. When the dawn showed, dove-coloured, across the steely
      waves, they stood up as well as they could for the tumbling of the ship.
      Pheles, that hardy sailor and adventurer, turned quite pale when he turned
      round suddenly and saw them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;well, I never did!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Master,&rsquo; said the Egyptian, bowing low, and that was even more difficult
      than standing up, &lsquo;we are here by the magic of the sacred Amulet that
      hangs round your neck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never did!&rsquo; repeated Pheles. &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What port is the ship bound for?&rsquo; asked Robert, with a nautical air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pheles said, &lsquo;Are you a navigator?&rsquo; Robert had to own that he was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Pheles, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that we&rsquo;re bound for the
      Tin Isles. Tyre alone knows where the Tin Isles are. It is a splendid
      secret we keep from all the world. It is as great a thing to us as your
      magic to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in quite a new voice, and seemed to respect both the children and
      the Amulet a good deal more than he had done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The King sent you, didn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered Pheles, &lsquo;he bade me set sail with half a score brave
      gentlemen and this crew. You shall go with us, and see many wonders.&rsquo; He
      bowed and left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are we going to do now?&rsquo; said Robert, when Pheles had caused them to
      be left along with a breakfast of dried fruits and a sort of hard biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait till he lands in the Tin Isles,&rsquo; said Rekh-mara, &lsquo;then we can get
      the barbarians to help us. We will attack him by night and tear the sacred
      Amulet from his accursed heathen neck,&rsquo; he added, grinding his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When shall we get to the Tin Isles?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;six months, perhaps, or a year,&rsquo; said the Egyptian cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A year of THIS?&rsquo; cried Jane, and Cyril, who was still feeling far too
      unwell to care about breakfast, hugged himself miserably and shuddered. It
      was Robert who said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, we can shorten that year. Jane, out with the Amulet! Wish that
      we were where the Amulet will be when the ship is twenty miles from the
      Tin Island. That&rsquo;ll give us time to mature our plans.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done&mdash;the work of a moment&mdash;and there they were on the
      same ship, between grey northern sky and grey northern sea. The sun was
      setting in a pale yellow line. It was the same ship, but it was changed,
      and so were the crew. Weather-worn and dirty were the sailors, and their
      clothes torn and ragged. And the children saw that, of course, though they
      had skipped the nine months, the ship had had to live through them. Pheles
      looked thinner, and his face was rugged and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;the charm has brought you back! I have prayed to it daily
      these nine months&mdash;and now you are here? Have you no magic that can
      help?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your need?&rsquo; asked the Egyptian quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I need a great wave that shall whelm away the foreign ship that follows
      us. A month ago it lay in wait for us, by the pillars of the gods, and it
      follows, follows, to find out the secret of Tyre&mdash;the place of the
      Tin Islands. If I could steer by night I could escape them yet, but
      tonight there will be no stars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My magic will not serve you here,&rsquo; said the Egyptian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Robert said, &lsquo;My magic will not bring up great waves, but I can show
      you how to steer without stars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out the shilling compass, still, fortunately, in working order,
      that he had bought off another boy at school for fivepence, a piece of
      indiarubber, a strip of whalebone, and half a stick of red sealing-wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he showed Pheles how it worked. And Pheles wondered at the compass&rsquo;s
      magic truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will give it to you,&rsquo; Robert said, &lsquo;in return for that charm about your
      neck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pheles made no answer. He first laughed, snatched the compass from
      Robert&rsquo;s hand, and turned away still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be comforted,&rsquo; the Priest whispered, &lsquo;our time will come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dusk deepened, and Pheles, crouched beside a dim lantern, steered by
      the shilling compass from the Crystal Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one ever knew how the other ship sailed, but suddenly, in the deep
      night, the look-out man at the stern cried out in a terrible voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is close upon us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we,&rsquo; said Pheles, &lsquo;are close to the harbour.&rsquo; He was silent a moment,
      then suddenly he altered the ship&rsquo;s course, and then he stood up and
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good friends and gentlemen,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;who are bound with me in this
      brave venture by our King&rsquo;s command, the false, foreign ship is close on
      our heels. If we land, they land, and only the gods know whether they
      might not beat us in fight, and themselves survive to carry back the tale
      of Tyre&rsquo;s secret island to enrich their own miserable land. Shall this
      be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; cried the half-dozen men near him. The slaves were rowing hard
      below and could not hear his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptian leaped upon him; suddenly, fiercely, as a wild beast leaps.
      &lsquo;Give me back my Amulet,&rsquo; he cried, and caught at the charm. The chain
      that held it snapped, and it lay in the Priest&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pheles laughed, standing balanced to the leap of the ship that answered
      the oarstroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is no time for charms and mummeries,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve lived like
      men, and we&rsquo;ll die like gentlemen for the honour and glory of Tyre, our
      splendid city. &ldquo;Tyre, Tyre for ever! It&rsquo;s Tyre that rules the waves.&rdquo; I
      steer her straight for the Dragon rocks, and we go down for our city, as
      brave men should. The creeping cowards who follow shall go down as slaves&mdash;and
      slaves they shall be to us&mdash;when we live again. Tyre, Tyre for ever!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A great shout went up, and the slaves below joined in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quick, the Amulet,&rsquo; cried Anthea, and held it up. Rekh-mara held up the
      one he had snatched from Pheles. The word was spoken, and the two great
      arches grew on the plunging ship in the shrieking wind under the dark sky.
      From each Amulet a great and beautiful green light streamed and shone far
      out over the waves. It illuminated, too, the black faces and jagged teeth
      of the great rocks that lay not two ships&rsquo; lengths from the boat&rsquo;s peaked
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tyre, Tyre for ever! It&rsquo;s Tyre that rules the waves!&rsquo; the voices of the
      doomed rose in a triumphant shout. The children scrambled through the
      arch, and stood trembling and blinking in the Fitzroy Street parlour, and
      in their ears still sounded the whistle of the wind, and the rattle of the
      oars, the crash of the ships bow on the rocks, and the last shout of the
      brave gentlemen-adventurers who went to their deaths singing, for the sake
      of the city they loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so we&rsquo;ve lost the other half of the Amulet again,&rsquo; said Anthea, when
      they had told the Psammead all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, pooh!&rsquo; said the Psammead. &lsquo;That wasn&rsquo;t the other half. It was
      the same half that you&rsquo;ve got&mdash;the one that wasn&rsquo;t crushed and lost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how could it be the same?&rsquo; said Anthea gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, not exactly, of course. The one you&rsquo;ve got is a good many years
      older, but at any rate it&rsquo;s not the other one. What did you say when you
      wished?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forget,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the Psammead. &lsquo;You said, &ldquo;Take us where YOU are&rdquo;&mdash;and
      it did, so you see it was the same half.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you mark my words,&rsquo; the Psammead went on, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll have trouble with
      that Priest yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he was quite friendly,&rsquo; said Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the same you&rsquo;d better beware of the Reverend Rekh-mara.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sick of the Amulet,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;we shall never get it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes we shall,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember December 3rd?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jinks!&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t feel at all well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I were you,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;I should not go out into the Past
      again till that date. You&rsquo;ll find it safer not to go where you&rsquo;re likely
      to meet that Egyptian any more just at present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll do as you say,&rsquo; said Anthea soothingly, &lsquo;though there&rsquo;s
      something about his face that I really do like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still, you don&rsquo;t want to run after him, I suppose,&rsquo; snapped the Psammead.
      &lsquo;You wait till the 3rd, and then see what happens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril and Jane were feeling far from well, Anthea was always obliging, so
      Robert was overruled. And they promised. And none of them, not even the
      Psammead, at all foresaw, as you no doubt do quite plainly, exactly what
      it was that WOULD happen on that memorable date.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 14. THE HEART&rsquo;S DESIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      If I only had time I could tell you lots of things. For instance, how, in
      spite of the advice of the Psammead, the four children did, one very wet
      day, go through their Amulet Arch into the golden desert, and there find
      the great Temple of Baalbec and meet with the Phoenix whom they never
      thought to see again. And how the Phoenix did not remember them at all
      until it went into a sort of prophetic trance&mdash;if that can be called
      remembering. But, alas! I HAVEN&rsquo;T time, so I must leave all that out
      though it was a wonderfully thrilling adventure. I must leave out, too,
      all about the visit of the children to the Hippodrome with the Psammead in
      its travelling bag, and about how the wishes of the people round about
      them were granted so suddenly and surprisingly that at last the Psammead
      had to be taken hurriedly home by Anthea, who consequently missed half the
      performance. Then there was the time when, Nurse having gone to tea with a
      friend out Ivalunk way, they were playing &lsquo;devil in the dark&rsquo;&mdash;and in
      the midst of that most creepy pastime the postman&rsquo;s knock frightened Jane
      nearly out of her life. She took in the letters, however, and put them in
      the back of the hat-stand drawer, so that they should be safe. And safe
      they were, for she never thought of them again for weeks and weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      One really good thing happened when they took the Psammead to a
      magic-lantern show and lecture at the boys&rsquo; school at Camden Town. The
      lecture was all about our soldiers in South Africa. And the lecturer ended
      up by saying, &lsquo;And I hope every boy in this room has in his heart the
      seeds of courage and heroism and self-sacrifice, and I wish that every one
      of you may grow up to be noble and brave and unselfish, worthy citizens of
      this great Empire for whom our soldiers have freely given their lives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, this came true&mdash;which was a distinct score for Camden
      Town.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Anthea said, it was unlucky that the lecturer said boys, because now
      she and Jane would have to be noble and unselfish, if at all, without any
      outside help. But Jane said, &lsquo;I daresay we are already because of our
      beautiful natures. It&rsquo;s only boys that have to be made brave by magic&rsquo;&mdash;which
      nearly led to a first-class row.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I daresay you would like to know all about the affair of the fishing
      rod, and the fish-hooks, and the cook next door&mdash;which was amusing
      from some points of view, though not perhaps the cook&rsquo;s&mdash;but there
      really is no time even for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing that there&rsquo;s time to tell about is the Adventure of
      Maskelyne and Cooke&rsquo;s, and the Unexpected Apparition&mdash;which is also
      the beginning of the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Nurse who broke into the gloomy music of the autumn rain on the
      window panes by suggesting a visit to the Egyptian Hall, England&rsquo;s Home of
      Mystery. Though they had good, but private reasons to know that their own
      particular personal mystery was of a very different brand, the four all
      brightened at the idea. All children, as well as a good many grown-ups,
      love conjuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s in Piccadilly,&rsquo; said old Nurse, carefully counting out the proper
      number of shillings into Cyril&rsquo;s hand, &lsquo;not so very far down on the left
      from the Circus. There&rsquo;s big pillars outside, something like Carter&rsquo;s seed
      place in Holborn, as used to be Day and Martin&rsquo;s blacking when I was a
      gell. And something like Euston Station, only not so big.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know,&rsquo; said everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they started.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though they walked along the left-hand side of Piccadilly they saw no
      pillared building that was at all like Carter&rsquo;s seed warehouse or Euston
      Station or England&rsquo;s Home of Mystery as they remembered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they stopped a hurried lady, and asked her the way to Maskelyne
      and Cooke&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; she said, pushing past them. &lsquo;I always shop at
      the Stores.&rsquo; Which just shows, as Jane said, how ignorant grown-up people
      are.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a policeman who at last explained to them that England&rsquo;s Mysteries
      are now appropriately enough enacted at St George&rsquo;s Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they tramped to Langham Place, and missed the first two items in the
      programme. But they were in time for the most wonderful magic appearances
      and disappearances, which they could hardly believe&mdash;even with all
      their knowledge of a larger magic&mdash;was not really magic after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If only the Babylonians could have seen THIS conjuring,&rsquo; whispered Cyril.
      &lsquo;It takes the shine out of their old conjurer, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Anthea and several other members of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was a vacant seat next to Robert. And it was when all eyes were
      fixed on the stage where Mr Devant was pouring out glasses of all sorts of
      different things to drink, out of one kettle with one spout, and the
      audience were delightedly tasting them, that Robert felt someone in that
      vacant seat. He did not feel someone sit down in it. It was just that one
      moment there was no one sitting there, and the next moment, suddenly,
      there was someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert turned. The someone who had suddenly filled that empty place was
      Rekh-mara, the Priest of Amen!
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the eyes of the audience were fixed on Mr David Devant, Mr David
      Devant&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the audience. And it happened that his eyes
      were more particularly fixed on that empty chair. So that he saw quite
      plainly the sudden appearance, from nowhere, of the Egyptian Priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A jolly good trick,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;and worked under my own eyes,
      in my own hall. I&rsquo;ll find out how that&rsquo;s done.&rsquo; He had never seen a trick
      that he could not do himself if he tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time a good many eyes in the audience had turned on the
      clean-shaven, curiously-dressed figure of the Egyptian Priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr Devant, rising to the occasion, &lsquo;this is a
      trick I have never before performed. The empty seat, third from the end,
      second row, gallery&mdash;you will now find occupied by an Ancient
      Egyptian, warranted genuine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He little knew how true his words were.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now all eyes were turned on the Priest and the children, and the whole
      audience, after a moment&rsquo;s breathless surprise, shouted applause. Only the
      lady on the other side of Rekh-mara drew back a little. She KNEW no one
      had passed her, and, as she said later, over tea and cold tongue, &lsquo;it was
      that sudden it made her flesh creep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rekh-mara seemed very much annoyed at the notice he was exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come out of this crowd,&rsquo; he whispered to Robert. &lsquo;I must talk with you
      apart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; Jane whispered. &lsquo;I did so want to see the Mascot Moth, and the
      Ventriloquist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you get here?&rsquo; was Robert&rsquo;s return whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you get to Egypt and to Tyre?&rsquo; retorted Rekh-mara. &lsquo;Come, let us
      leave this crowd.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it, I suppose,&rsquo; Robert shrugged angrily. But they all
      got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confederates!&rsquo; said a man in the row behind. &lsquo;Now they go round to the
      back and take part in the next scene.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we did,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confederate yourself!&rsquo; said Cyril. And so they got away, the audience
      applauding to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vestibule of St George&rsquo;s Hall they disguised Rekh-mara as well as
      they could, but even with Robert&rsquo;s hat and Cyril&rsquo;s Inverness cape he was
      too striking a figure for foot-exercise in the London streets. It had to
      be a cab, and it took the last, least money of all of them. They stopped
      the cab a few doors from home, and then the girls went in and engaged old
      Nurse&rsquo;s attention by an account of the conjuring and a fervent entreaty
      for dripping-toast with their tea, leaving the front door open so that
      while Nurse was talking to them the boys could creep quietly in with
      Rekh-mara and smuggle him, unseen, up the stairs into their bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the girls came up they found the Egyptian Priest sitting on the side
      of Cyril&rsquo;s bed, his hands on his knees, looking like a statue of a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Cyril impatiently. &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t begin till we&rsquo;re all here.
      And shut the door, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door was shut the Egyptian said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My interests and yours are one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very interesting,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;ll be a jolly sight more
      interesting if you keep following us about in a decent country with no
      more clothes on than THAT!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace,&rsquo; said the Priest. &lsquo;What is this country? and what is this time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The country&rsquo;s England,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;and the time&rsquo;s about 6,000 years
      later than YOUR time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Amulet, then,&rsquo; said the Priest, deeply thoughtful, &lsquo;gives the power
      to move to and fro in time as well as in space?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rsquo; said Cyril gruffly. &lsquo;Look here, it&rsquo;ll be tea-time
      directly. What are we to do with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have one-half of the Amulet, I the other,&rsquo; said Rekh-mara. &lsquo;All that
      is now needed is the pin to join them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it,&rsquo; said Robert. &lsquo;The half you&rsquo;ve got is the same half
      as the one we&rsquo;ve got.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the same thing cannot be in the same place and the same time, and yet
      be not one, but twain,&rsquo; said the Priest. &lsquo;See, here is my half.&rsquo; He laid
      it on the Marcella counterpane. &lsquo;Where is yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane watching the eyes of the others, unfastened the string of the Amulet
      and laid it on the bed, but too far off for the Priest to seize it, even
      if he had been so dishonourable. Cyril and Robert stood beside him, ready
      to spring on him if one of his hands had moved but ever so little towards
      the magic treasure that was theirs. But his hands did not move, only his
      eyes opened very wide, and so did everyone else&rsquo;s for the Amulet the
      Priest had now quivered and shook; and then, as steel is drawn to the
      magnet, it was drawn across the white counterpane, nearer and nearer to
      the Amulet, warm from the neck of Jane. And then, as one drop of water
      mingles with another on a rain-wrinkled window-pane, as one bead of
      quick-silver is drawn into another bead, Rekh-mara&rsquo;s Amulet slipped into
      the other one, and, behold! there was no more but the one Amulet!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Black magic!&rsquo; cried Rekh-mara, and sprang forward to snatch the Amulet
      that had swallowed his. But Anthea caught it up, and at the same moment
      the Priest was jerked back by a rope thrown over his head. It drew,
      tightened with the pull of his forward leap, and bound his elbows to his
      sides. Before he had time to use his strength to free himself, Robert had
      knotted the cord behind him and tied it to the bedpost. Then the four
      children, overcoming the priest&rsquo;s wrigglings and kickings, tied his legs
      with more rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; said Robert, breathing hard, and drawing the last knot tight,
      &lsquo;he&rsquo;d have a try for OURS, so I got the ropes out of the box-room, so as
      to be ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls, with rather white faces, applauded his foresight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Loosen these bonds!&rsquo; cried Rekh-mara in fury, &lsquo;before I blast you with
      the seven secret curses of Amen-Ra!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t be likely to loose them AFTER,&rsquo; Robert retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t quarrel!&rsquo; said Anthea desperately. &lsquo;Look here, he has just as
      much right to the thing as we have. This,&rsquo; she took up the Amulet that had
      swallowed the other one, &lsquo;this has got his in it as well as being ours.
      Let&rsquo;s go shares.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go!&rsquo; cried the Priest, writhing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;if you make a row we can just open that
      window and call the police&mdash;the guards, you know&mdash;and tell them
      you&rsquo;ve been trying to rob us. NOW will you shut up and listen to reason?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose so,&rsquo; said Rekh-mara sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But reason could not be spoken to him till a whispered counsel had been
      held in the far corner by the washhand-stand and the towel-horse, a
      counsel rather long and very earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Anthea detached herself from the group, and went back to the
      Priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; she said in her kind little voice, &lsquo;we want to be friends. We
      want to help you. Let&rsquo;s make a treaty. Let&rsquo;s join together to get the
      Amulet&mdash;the whole one, I mean. And then it shall belong to you as
      much as to us, and we shall all get our hearts&rsquo; desire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fair words,&rsquo; said the Priest, &lsquo;grow no onions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;WE say, &ldquo;Butter no parsnips&rdquo;,&rsquo; Jane put in. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you see we WANT to
      be fair? Only we want to bind you in the chains of honour and upright
      dealing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you deal fairly by us?&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said the Priest. &lsquo;By the sacred, secret name that is written
      under the Altar of Amen-Ra, I will deal fairly by you. Will you, too, take
      the oath of honourable partnership?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Anthea, on the instant, and added rather rashly. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t
      swear in England, except in police courts, where the guards are, you know,
      and you don&rsquo;t want to go there. But when we SAY we&rsquo;ll do a thing&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      the same as an oath to us&mdash;we do it. You trust us, and we&rsquo;ll trust
      you.&rsquo; She began to unbind his legs, and the boys hastened to untie his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was free he stood up, stretched his arms, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am stronger than you and my oath is void. I have sworn
      by nothing, and my oath is nothing likewise. For there IS no secret,
      sacred name under the altar of Amen-Ra.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes there is!&rsquo; said a voice from under the bed. Everyone started&mdash;Rekh-mara
      most of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril stooped and pulled out the bath of sand where the Psammead slept.
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know everything, though you ARE a Divine Father of the Temple
      of Amen,&rsquo; said the Psammead shaking itself till the sand fell tinkling on
      the bath edge. &lsquo;There IS a secret, sacred name beneath the altar of
      Amen-Ra. Shall I call on that name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; cried the Priest in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Jane, too. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have any calling names.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; said Rekh-mara, who had turned very white indeed under his
      natural brownness, &lsquo;I was only going to say that though there isn&rsquo;t any
      name under&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There IS,&rsquo; said the Psammead threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, even if there WASN&rsquo;T, I will be bound by the wordless oath of your
      strangely upright land, and having said that I will be your friend&mdash;I
      will be it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then that&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said the Psammead; &lsquo;and there&rsquo;s the tea-bell.
      What are you going to do with your distinguished partner? He can&rsquo;t go down
      to tea like that, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see we can&rsquo;t do anything till the 3rd of December,&rsquo; said Anthea,
      &lsquo;that&rsquo;s when we are to find the whole charm. What can we do with Rekh-mara
      till then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Box-room,&rsquo; said Cyril briefly, &lsquo;and smuggle up his meals. It will be
      rather fun.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like a fleeing Cavalier concealed from exasperated Roundheads,&rsquo; said
      Robert. &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Rekh-mara was taken up to the box-room and made as comfortable as
      possible in a snug nook between an old nursery fender and the wreck of a
      big four-poster. They gave him a big rag-bag to sit on, and an old,
      moth-eaten fur coat off the nail on the door to keep him warm. And when
      they had had their own tea they took him some. He did not like the tea at
      all, but he liked the bread and butter, and cake that went with it. They
      took it in turns to sit with him during the evening, and left him fairly
      happy and quite settled for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they went up in the morning with a kipper, a quarter of which
      each of them had gone without at breakfast, Rekh-mara was gone! There was
      the cosy corner with the rag-bag, and the moth-eaten fur coat&mdash;but
      the cosy corner was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good riddance!&rsquo; was naturally the first delightful thought in each mind.
      The second was less pleasing, because everyone at once remembered that
      since his Amulet had been swallowed up by theirs&mdash;which hung once
      more round the neck of Jane&mdash;he could have no possible means of
      returning to his Egyptian past. Therefore he must be still in England, and
      probably somewhere quite near them, plotting mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attic was searched, to prevent mistakes, but quite vainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The best thing we can do,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;is to go through the half Amulet
      straight away, get the whole Amulet, and come back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; Anthea hesitated. &lsquo;Would that be quite fair? Perhaps he
      isn&rsquo;t really a base deceiver. Perhaps something&rsquo;s happened to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happened?&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;not it! Besides, what COULD happen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Anthea. &lsquo;Perhaps burglars came in the night, and
      accidentally killed him, and took away the&mdash;all that was mortal of
      him, you know&mdash;to avoid discovery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or perhaps,&rsquo; said Cyril, &lsquo;they hid the&mdash;all that was mortal, in one
      of those big trunks in the box-room. SHALL WE GO BACK AND LOOK?&rsquo; he added
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; Jane shuddered. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go and tell the Psammead and see what it
      says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s ask the learned gentleman. If anything has
      happened to Rekh-mara a gentleman&rsquo;s advice would be more useful than a
      Psammead&rsquo;s. And the learned gentleman&rsquo;ll only think it&rsquo;s a dream, like he
      always does.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They tapped at the door, and on the &lsquo;Come in&rsquo; entered. The learned
      gentleman was sitting in front of his untasted breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite him, in the easy chair, sat Rekh-mara!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said the learned gentleman very earnestly, &lsquo;please, hush! or the
      dream will go. I am learning... Oh, what have I not learned in the last
      hour!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the grey dawn,&rsquo; said the Priest, &lsquo;I left my hiding-place, and finding
      myself among these treasures from my own country, I remained. I feel more
      at home here somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I know it&rsquo;s a dream,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman feverishly,
      &lsquo;but, oh, ye gods! what a dream! By jove!...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call not upon the gods,&rsquo; said the Priest, &lsquo;lest ye raise greater ones
      than ye can control. Already,&rsquo; he explained to the children, &lsquo;he and I are
      as brothers, and his welfare is dear to me as my own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has told me,&rsquo; the learned gentleman began, but Robert interrupted.
      This was no moment for manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you told him,&rsquo; he asked the Priest, &lsquo;all about the Amulet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Rekh-mara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then tell him now. He is very learned. Perhaps he can tell us what to
      do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rekh-mara hesitated, then told&mdash;and, oddly enough, none of the
      children ever could remember afterwards what it was that he did tell.
      Perhaps he used some magic to prevent their remembering.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had done the learned gentleman was silent, leaning his elbow on
      the table and his head on his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Jimmy,&rsquo; said Anthea gently, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t worry about it. We are sure to
      find it today, somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rekh-mara, &lsquo;and perhaps, with it, Death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s to bring us our hearts&rsquo; desire,&rsquo; said Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who knows,&rsquo; said the Priest, &lsquo;what things undreamed-of and infinitely
      desirable lie beyond the dark gates?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, DON&rsquo;T,&rsquo; said Jane, almost whimpering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman raised his head suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not,&rsquo; he suggested, &lsquo;go back into the Past? At a moment when the
      Amulet is unwatched. Wish to be with it, and that it shall be under your
      hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the simplest thing in the world! And yet none of them had ever
      thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; cried Rekh-mara, leaping up. &lsquo;Come NOW!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May&mdash;may I come?&rsquo; the learned gentleman timidly asked. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a
      dream, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, and welcome, oh brother,&rsquo; Rekh-mara was beginning, but Cyril and
      Robert with one voice cried, &lsquo;NO.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You weren&rsquo;t with us in Atlantis,&rsquo; Robert added, &lsquo;or you&rsquo;d know better
      than to let him come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Jimmy,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;please don&rsquo;t ask to come. We&rsquo;ll go and be back
      again before you have time to know that we&rsquo;re gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he, too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must keep together,&rsquo; said Rekh-mara, &lsquo;since there is but one perfect
      Amulet to which I and these children have equal claims.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane held up the Amulet&mdash;Rekh-mara went first&mdash;and they all
      passed through the great arch into which the Amulet grew at the Name of
      Power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned gentleman saw through the arch a darkness lighted by smoky
      gleams. He rubbed his eyes. And he only rubbed them for ten seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children and the Priest were in a small, dark chamber. A square
      doorway of massive stone let in gleams of shifting light, and the sound of
      many voices chanting a slow, strange hymn. They stood listening. Now and
      then the chant quickened and the light grew brighter, as though fuel had
      been thrown on a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we?&rsquo; whispered Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when?&rsquo; whispered Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is some shrine near the beginnings of belief,&rsquo; said the Egyptian
      shivering. &lsquo;Take the Amulet and come away. It is cold here in the morning
      of the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Jane felt that her hand was on a slab or table of stone, and,
      under her hand, something that felt like the charm that had so long hung
      round her neck, only it was thicker. Twice as thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s HERE!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rsquo; And she hardly knew the sound of her
      own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come away,&rsquo; repeated Rekh-mara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we could see more of this Temple,&rsquo; said Robert resistingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come away,&rsquo; the Priest urged, &lsquo;there is death all about, and strong
      magic. Listen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The chanting voices seemed to have grown louder and fiercer, and light
      stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are coming!&rsquo; cried Rekh-mara. &lsquo;Quick, quick, the Amulet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane held it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a long time you&rsquo;ve been rubbing your eyes!&rsquo; said Anthea; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you
      see we&rsquo;ve got back?&rsquo; The learned gentleman merely stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Anthea&mdash;Miss Jane!&rsquo; It was Nurse&rsquo;s voice, very much higher and
      squeaky and more exalted than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, bother!&rsquo; said everyone. Cyril adding, &lsquo;You just go on with the dream
      for a sec, Mr Jimmy, we&rsquo;ll be back directly. Nurse&rsquo;ll come up if we don&rsquo;t.
      SHE wouldn&rsquo;t think Rekh-mara was a dream.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went down. Nurse was in the hall, an orange envelope in one
      hand, and a pink paper in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Pa and Ma&rsquo;s come home. &ldquo;Reach London 11.15. Prepare rooms as
      directed in letter&rdquo;, and signed in their two names.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, hooray! hooray! hooray!&rsquo; shouted the boys and Jane. But Anthea could
      not shout, she was nearer crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she said almost in a whisper, &lsquo;then it WAS true. And we HAVE got our
      hearts&rsquo; desire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand about the letter,&rsquo; Nurse was saying. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      HAD no letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;OH!&rsquo; said Jane in a queer voice, &lsquo;I wonder whether it was one of those...
      they came that night&mdash;you know, when we were playing &ldquo;devil in the
      dark&rdquo;&mdash;and I put them in the hat-stand drawer, behind the
      clothes-brushes and&rsquo;&mdash;she pulled out the drawer as she spoke&mdash;&lsquo;and
      here they are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a letter for Nurse and one for the children. The letters told
      how Father had done being a war-correspondent and was coming home; and how
      Mother and The Lamb were going to meet him in Italy and all come home
      together; and how The Lamb and Mother were quite well; and how a telegram
      would be sent to tell the day and the hour of their home-coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercy me!&rsquo; said old Nurse. &lsquo;I declare if it&rsquo;s not too bad of You, Miss
      Jane. I shall have a nice to-do getting things straight for your Pa and
      Ma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, never mind, Nurse,&rsquo; said Jane, hugging her; &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t it just too lovely
      for anything!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll come and help you,&rsquo; said Cyril. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s just something upstairs
      we&rsquo;ve got to settle up, and then we&rsquo;ll all come and help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get along with you,&rsquo; said old Nurse, but she laughed jollily. &lsquo;Nice help
      YOU&rsquo;D be. I know you. And it&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, in fact, something upstairs that they had to settle. Quite a
      considerable something, too. And it took much longer than they expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hasty rush into the boys&rsquo; room secured the Psammead, very sandy and very
      cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how cross and sandy it is though,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;it
      ought to be there at the final council.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll give the learned gentleman fits, I expect,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;when he
      sees it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But it didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The dream is growing more and more wonderful,&rsquo; he exclaimed, when the
      Psammead had been explained to him by Rekh-mara. &lsquo;I have dreamed this
      beast before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;Jane has got the half Amulet and I&rsquo;ve got the whole.
      Show up, Jane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane untied the string and laid her half Amulet on the table, littered
      with dusty papers, and the clay cylinders marked all over with little
      marks like the little prints of birds&rsquo; little feet. Robert laid down the
      whole Amulet, and Anthea gently restrained the eager hand of the learned
      gentleman as it reached out yearningly towards the &lsquo;perfect specimen&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, just as before on the Marcella quilt, so now on the dusty litter
      of papers and curiosities, the half Amulet quivered and shook, and then,
      as steel is drawn to a magnet, it was drawn across the dusty manuscripts,
      nearer and nearer to the perfect Amulet, warm from the pocket of Robert.
      And then, as one drop of water mingles with another when the panes of the
      window are wrinkled with rain, as one bead of mercury is drawn into
      another bead, the half Amulet, that was the children&rsquo;s and was also
      Rekh-mara&rsquo;s,&mdash;slipped into the whole Amulet, and, behold! there was
      only one&mdash;the perfect and ultimate Charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And THAT&rsquo;S all right,&rsquo; said the Psammead, breaking a breathless silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anthea, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;ve got our hearts&rsquo; desire. Father and Mother
      and The Lamb are coming home today.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what about me?&rsquo; said Rekh-mara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What IS your heart&rsquo;s desire?&rsquo; Anthea asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great and deep learning,&rsquo; said the Priest, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
      &lsquo;A learning greater and deeper than that of any man of my land and my
      time. But learning too great is useless. If I go back to my own land and
      my own age, who will believe my tales of what I have seen in the future?
      Let me stay here, be the great knower of all that has been, in that our
      time, so living to me, so old to you, about which your learned men
      speculate unceasingly, and often, HE tells me, vainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I were you,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;I should ask the Amulet about that.
      It&rsquo;s a dangerous thing, trying to live in a time that&rsquo;s not your own. You
      can&rsquo;t breathe an air that&rsquo;s thousands of centuries ahead of your lungs
      without feeling the effects of it, sooner or later. Prepare the mystic
      circle and consult the Amulet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, WHAT a dream!&rsquo; cried the learned gentleman. &lsquo;Dear children, if you
      love me&mdash;and I think you do, in dreams and out of them&mdash;prepare
      the mystic circle and consult the Amulet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They did. As once before, when the sun had shone in August splendour, they
      crouched in a circle on the floor. Now the air outside was thick and
      yellow with the fog that by some strange decree always attends the Cattle
      Show week. And in the street costers were shouting. &lsquo;Ur Hekau Setcheh,&rsquo; 
      Jane said the Name of Power. And instantly the light went out, and all the
      sounds went out too, so that there was a silence and a darkness, both
      deeper than any darkness or silence that you have ever even dreamed of
      imagining. It was like being deaf or blind, only darker and quieter even
      than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then out of that vast darkness and silence came a light and a voice. The
      light was too faint to see anything by, and the voice was too small for
      you to hear what it said. But the light and the voice grew. And the light
      was the light that no man may look on and live, and the voice was the
      sweetest and most terrible voice in the world. The children cast down
      their eyes. And so did everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I speak,&rsquo; said the voice. &lsquo;What is it that you would hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Everyone was afraid to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are we to do about Rekh-mara?&rsquo; said Robert suddenly and abruptly.
      &lsquo;Shall he go back through the Amulet to his own time, or&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one can pass through the Amulet now,&rsquo; said the beautiful, terrible
      voice, &lsquo;to any land or any time. Only when it was imperfect could such
      things be. But men may pass through the perfect charm to the perfect
      union, which is not of time or space.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you be so very kind,&rsquo; said Anthea tremulously, &lsquo;as to speak so that
      we can understand you? The Psammead said something about Rekh-mara not
      being able to live here, and if he can&rsquo;t get back&mdash;&rsquo; She stopped, her
      heart was beating desperately in her throat, as it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody can continue to live in a land and in a time not appointed,&rsquo; said
      the voice of glorious sweetness. &lsquo;But a soul may live, if in that other
      time and land there be found a soul so akin to it as to offer it refuge,
      in the body of that land and time, that thus they two may be one soul in
      one body.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The children exchanged discouraged glances. But the eyes of Rekh-mara and
      the learned gentleman met, and were kind to each other, and promised each
      other many things, secret and sacred and very beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthea saw the look. &lsquo;Oh, but,&rsquo; she said, without at all meaning to say
      it, &lsquo;dear Jimmy&rsquo;s soul isn&rsquo;t at all like Rekh-mara&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m certain it
      isn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to be rude, but it ISN&rsquo;T, you know. Dear Jimmy&rsquo;s soul
      is as good as gold, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing that is not good can pass beneath the double arch of my perfect
      Amulet,&rsquo; said the voice. &lsquo;If both are willing, say the word of Power, and
      let the two souls become one for ever and ever more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I?&rsquo; asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices were those of the Egyptian Priest and the learned gentleman,
      and the voices were eager, alive, thrilled with hope and the desire of
      great things.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Jane took the Amulet from Robert and held it up between the two men,
      and said, for the last time, the word of Power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ur Hekau Setcheh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfect Amulet grew into a double arch; the two arches leaned to each
      other making a great A.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A stands for Amen,&rsquo; whispered Jane; &lsquo;what he was a priest of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; breathed Anthea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great double arch glowed in and through the green light that had been
      there since the Name of Power had first been spoken&mdash;it glowed with a
      light more bright yet more soft than the other light&mdash;a glory and
      splendour and sweetness unspeakable. &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; cried Rekh-mara, holding out
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; cried the learned gentleman, and he also held out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each moved forward under the glowing, glorious arch of the perfect Amulet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Rekh-mara quavered and shook, and as steel is drawn to a magnet he
      was drawn, under the arch of magic, nearer and nearer to the learned
      gentleman. And, as one drop of water mingles with another, when the
      window-glass is rain-wrinkled, as one quick-silver bead is drawn to
      another quick-silver bead, Rekh-mara, Divine Father of the Temple of
      Amen-Ra, was drawn into, slipped into, disappeared into, and was one with
      Jimmy, the good, the beloved, the learned gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly it was good daylight and the December sun shone. The fog has
      passed away like a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Amulet was there&mdash;little and complete in jane&rsquo;s hand, and there
      were the other children and the Psammead, and the learned gentleman. But
      Rekh-mara&mdash;or the body of Rekh-mara&mdash;was not there any more. As
      for his soul...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the horrid thing!&rsquo; cried Robert, and put his foot on a centipede as
      long as your finger, that crawled and wriggled and squirmed at the learned
      gentleman&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;THAT,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;WAS the evil in the soul of Rekh-mara.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a deep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then Rekh-mara&rsquo;s HIM now?&rsquo; said Jane at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All that was good in Rekh-mara,&rsquo; said the Psammead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;HE ought to have his heart&rsquo;s desire, too,&rsquo; said Anthea, in a sort of
      stubborn gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;HIS heart&rsquo;s desire,&rsquo; said the Psammead, &lsquo;is the perfect Amulet you hold
      in your hand. Yes&mdash;and has been ever since he first saw the broken
      half of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got ours,&rsquo; said Anthea softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Psammead&mdash;its voice was crosser than they had ever
      heard it&mdash;&lsquo;your parents are coming home. And what&rsquo;s to become of ME?
      I shall be found out, and made a show of, and degraded in every possible
      way. I KNOW they&rsquo;ll make me go into Parliament&mdash;hateful place&mdash;all
      mud and no sand. That beautiful Baalbec temple in the desert! Plenty of
      good sand there, and no politics! I wish I were there, safe in the Past&mdash;that
      I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you were,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman absently, yet polite as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Psammead swelled itself up, turned its long snail&rsquo;s eyes in one last
      lingering look at Anthea&mdash;a loving look, she always said, and thought&mdash;and&mdash;vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Anthea, after a silence, &lsquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s happy. The only
      thing it ever did really care for was SAND.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear children,&rsquo; said the learned gentleman, &lsquo;I must have fallen
      asleep. I&rsquo;ve had the most extraordinary dream.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope it was a nice one,&rsquo; said Cyril with courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.... I feel a new man after it. Absolutely a new man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a ring at the front-door bell. The opening of a door. Voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s THEM!&rsquo; cried Robert, and a thrill ran through four hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; cried Anthea, snatching the Amulet from Jane and pressing it into
      the hand of the learned gentleman. &lsquo;Here&mdash;it&rsquo;s yours&mdash;your very
      own&mdash;a present from us, because you&rsquo;re Rekh-mara as well as... I
      mean, because you&rsquo;re such a dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hugged him briefly but fervently, and the four swept down the stairs
      to the hall, where a cabman was bringing in boxes, and where, heavily
      disguised in travelling cloaks and wraps, was their hearts&rsquo; desire&mdash;three-fold&mdash;Mother,
      Father, and The Lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless me!&rsquo; said the learned gentleman, left alone, &lsquo;bless me! What a
      treasure! The dear children! It must be their affection that has given me
      these luminous apercus. I seem to see so many things now&mdash;things I
      never saw before! The dear children! The dear, dear children!&rsquo; 
    </p>

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
