description: "The Story of the Amulet is a novel for children, written in 1906 by\
  \ English author Edith Nesbit.\nIt is the final part of a trilogy of novels that\
  \ also includes Five Children and It (1902) and The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904).\
  \ In it the children re-encounter the Psammeadâ€”the \"it\" in Five Children and It.\
  \ As it no longer grants wishes to the children, however, its capacity is mainly\
  \ advisory in relation to the children's other discovery, the Amulet, thus following\
  \ a formula successfully established in The Phoenix and the Carpet.\n From Wikipedia\
